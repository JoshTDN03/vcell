	<introduction> 	
A table of pathway entities can be used to examine their properties and their linkage to Physiology. 
It is the table format representation of the 
		<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> Pathway Diagram View</link>.
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>  
	<imgReference target = "PathwayObjectsView.png"></imgReference>
	<para>
The table view shows the pathway entities, their type and linked objects within the physiology. 
For example, the selected reaction and its participants are already 
linked to reaction and species in physiology.
</para>
<para>
For every selected object in the top view the bottom pane of the window displays 
		<link target = "PP_Pathways">Object Properties</link>, such as name, linked physiolofy objects, 
		reaction participants for reaction, 
		clickable links to original databases and publications, comments etc.   
</para>
	</appearance>
		
	<operations>  
The user can perform various operations upon these entities, either on individually selected 
entities or multiple selected entities using the 
		<link target = "GroupOperationsPanel"> Entities Management Toolbar</link>. Clicking on
<link target="PathLink">Physiology Links</link> button will either show linked physiology objects for selected 
pathway entities, or allow editing them, or establish new links.

		<para>
The table items can be sorted alphabetically by any column by clicking on the column header. 
As an added capability, the items in the table can be filtered in real time by typing a string 
inside the Search field.
