	<introduction>
	Applications allow users to define the quantitative conditions needed to define, 
	run and visualize a Virtual Experiment, i.e. a numerical simulation of the BioModel 
	with specific initial conditions, within a given geometry, and with a selected type 
	of simulation method. In the Application,
	<list> 
	<item>the mapping between the model and the geometry 
	is established in the <link target="GeometryOverview">Geometry</link> tab</item>
	<item><link target="SpecificationsOverview"> Specifications</link> for species, reactions and network 
	(for rule-based application) are defined,</item> 
	<item>specific <link target="ProtocolsOverview"> Protocols</link> 
	(events, electric stimulation) can be included,</item> 
	<item>for each application, multiple <link target="simulations_overview">Simulations</link> 
	can be created that can include different initial conditions.

	<list> 
	<item>Compartmental (1D, 2D or 3D), where topology and size of compartments are defined, but species are assumed 
	to be well mixed within their compartments. Such application is simulated using either differential equations
	(for <def target="def_Deterministic">deterministic</def> application), or using stochastic simulation algorithms 
	(for <def target="def_Stochastic">stochastic</def> application).  </item>
	<item>Spatial (2D or 3D), where geometry of compartments is defined, 
	and species are not well mixed but diffuse within compartments. Such application is 
	simulated using either partial differential equations
	(for <def target="def_Deterministic">deterministic</def> application), or using stochastic agent-based
	 simulation algorithms SmolDyn
	(for <def target="def_Stochastic">stochastic</def> application).</item> 
	</list>
	The Application directory displays the Applications associated with the BioModel. The main window 
	displays the selected application and provides buttons to create new applications or to 
	delete or copy applications. Properties for a selected object (e.g. species, reaction, simulation) 
	are displayed in the Properties Pane below the main window.
