	<introduction>
	Applications allow users to define the quantitative conditions needed to define, 
	run and visualize a Virtual Experiment, i.e. a numerical simulation of the BioModel 
	with specific initial conditions, within a given geometry, and with a selected type 
	of simulation method. In the Application the mapping between the model and the geometry 
	is established, Specifications for species and reactions are defined, and specific Protocols
	(events, electric stimulation) can be included. An Application is
	created as either <def target="def_Deterministic">Deterministic</def> or 
	<def target="def_Stochastic">Stochastic</def>. For each application, multiple simulations 
	can be created that can be either spatial or nonspatial and include different initial conditions.
	</introduction>

	<appearance>  
	The Application directory displays the Applications associated with the BioModel. The main window 
	displays the selected application and provides buttons to create new applications or to 
	delete or copy applications. Properties for a selected object (e.g. species, reaction, simulation) 
	are displayed in the Properties Pane below the main window.
