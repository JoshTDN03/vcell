	<introduction>
		For every model specified in a single compartment and having only mass-action kinetics, 
		a modeler is able to create a new rule-based BioModel. Every rule-based enabled element of a model
		(molecules, observables, species with molecular details, reaction rules) are transferred to a new
		model without changes. Regular elements of a model (species without molecular detail and reactions) are
		converted into rule-based physiology by generating of molecule per species, and having reactions written
		as fully-defined reaction rules.	
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>
		For user convenience, the Network-Free tab provides statistics of rule-enabled and regular elements of
		current model physiology, and the same stgatistics for the rule-based model to be created.

	<para>Note that the same reaction expression treated as a reaction and as a reaction 
		rule will have different rates:
</para>
	
	<list>
		<item>
			VCell will take care of reactions of the form A + A -> product(s), and the rate of generated 
			reaction rules will be multiplied by 2 to account for symmetry factors. </item>
		<item>VCell does not take care of reactions where reactants have symmetric sites and reaction 
			rule will have a statistical factor. If this is not properly treated by a modeler, the resultant rule-based model may show different simulation results than its network precursor.
