	<introduction>
		For every model specified in a single compartment and having only mass-action kinetics, 
		a modeler is able to create a new rule-based BioModel. Every rule-based enabled element of a model
		(molecules, observables, species with molecular details, reaction rules) are transferred to a new
		model without changes. Regular elements of a model (species without molecular detail and reactions) are
		converted into rule-based physiology by generating of molecule per species, and having reactions written
		as fully-defined reaction rules.	
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>
		For user convenience, the Network-Free tab provides statistics of rule-enabled and regular elements of
		current model physiology, and the same stgatistics for the rule-based model to be created.
