<introduction>
Image based (gif, jpeg, quicktime mov) and text based (spreadsheet csv) export formats will display an additional dialog when the 'start export' button is pressed.  
The dialog displays additional controls that alter the appearance or structure of the final export file.  
Mesh based(vtk, ucd) have no additional dialogue.

<list>
<item><bold>Encoding Format </bold> 
setting will be 'JPEG' for jpeg image and QuickTime movies.  The setting will be 'GIF' for gif images.
</item>
<item><bold>File Compression</bold> 
slider is enabled for jpeg and QuickTime formats.  
Moving the slider to any position other than 'lossless' will create smaller export files at the expense of image quality.  
The slider is disabled for GIF image export as that format always uses 'lossless' compression.
</item>
<item><bold>Variables Display Composition </bold> 
is enabled if more than 1 variable has been chosen for export.  
The 'Separate' button tells the exporter to create a separate export file for each variable chosen to export.  
The 'Combined' button tells the exporter to create a 'montage' of all the variable images in one export file.
</item>
<item><bold>QuickTime Format </bold> 
is enabled for QuickTime format type.  
The 'Regular' button creates a normal QuickTime movie, 1 image for each frame of the movie.  
The 'QTVR' button will tell the exporter to create a specially format export file readable by QuickTime players.  
This format allows the player to display multiple images at each movie time point controllable by the user (see Apple QuickTime QTVR) for more information).
</item>
<item><bold>Volume Var Membrane Outline Thickness </bold> 
is always enabled.    
Setting the slider to 'Hide' will disable the rendering of a membrane outline to the slice plane being exported.
Numerical slider values will cause the rendering of membrane outlines the same way as they are viewed in the Slice Data Viewer.
</item>
<item><bold>Variables Mirroring </bold> 
is always enabled.  
For settings other than 'No mirroring', tells the exported to copy and 'flip' each image along the selected axis.  
This setting is a convenience to create 'whole' images from partial simulation geometries that were defined by the user to take advantage of spatial symmetries.
</item>
<item><bold>Image Size Scaling </bold> 
is always enabled.  
If 'from View Data zoom' is chosen the exported images will be the same as the View Data display.  
Otherwise exported images horizontal and vertical axes will be stretched by the scaling value chosen.
</item>
<item><bold>Membrane Variable Thickness </bold> 
is enabled when membrane variables are being exported.  
The slider sets the size in pixels of the rendered membrane in a slice.
</item>
<item><bold>Movie Duration (seconds) </bold> 
is enables when QuickTime mov format is chosen.  
Sets the amount of time the movie will take to do one complete play-through.
</item>
<item><bold>Particle Mode </bold> 
is enabled when a 'particle' variable is chosen to export.  
Selecting 'Particles' will cause an image of 'spheres' rendered at their location in space for the exported slice and times.  
'Histogram' exports an image where each slice pixel is colored according to how many particles where at the corresponding point in the mesh for each time
</item>
<item><bold>Continue...</bold> 
will display a summary of the settings you have chosen and give information about the resulting export file size.
