<page title="Spatial Simulation Results Overview">

	
	<introduction>
	Simulation solvers producing 1,2 or 3 dimensional spatial domain results are viewed with the Spatial Results Viewer:
	<list>
	<item>
	The <link target = "SimResSpatialSliceView">View Data</link> tab contains a panel to display 3 dimensional data as orthogonal (x,y,z) slices for volume data or surface renderings for membrane data.  
	<bold>Slice viewer</bold> controls for volume data allow the user to select a <bold>variable</bold>, a specific simulation <bold>time-point</bold>, a <bold>slice</bold> plane if 3D, 
	a <bold>data range</bold> for display color scaling, a <bold>color</bold> colormap for basic display settings.  
	Other controls include zoom, pan, region-of-interest(roi) (point, line, simple open and closed polygons), roi plots and statistical summary plots.  
	<bold>Surface viewer</bold> controls allow for the manipulation in 3D of rendered membrane variables.
	</item>
	<item>The <link target = "ExportingSpatialSimResults">Export Results</link> tab is used to select variable, time and roi data to export in movie, image, mesh, raw and spreadsheet formats.</item> 
	<item>The <link target = "PostProcessingStats">Post Processing Stats Data</link> tab displays compartment summary data (mean, sum) automatically generated by VCell solvers at each simulation time-point.</item>
	<item>The <link target = "PostProcessingImage">Post Processing Image Data</link> tab displays data generated by <link target = "MicroscopeMeasurement">Microscope Measurement</link> definitions.</item>
	</list>
	<imgReference target = "SimResSpatialSliceView.png"/>
	<para>
The image data from spatial simulations are displayed in the results dialog. You can also generate a Spatial Plot, using defined regions, a Time Plot, using points, or a Kymograph, which displays a line scan over time.
     </para>

	</para>
The Simulation Results Viewer has three tabs: View Data, Export Data and Post Processing Results. The following sections describe functions within the View Data tab.

The image data from spatial simulations are displayed in the results dialog. You can also generate a Spatial Plot, using defined regions, a Time Plot, using points, or a Kymograph, which displays a line scan over time.

	<list>
	<para>Time: The data time point that is displayed. Enter a value in the text field or click once on the selection arrow. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to select a time point (note that the time slider must be selected -- by being clicked upon first). The image will update when the time point is changed.
</para>
<para>
All Variables: 
All Variables from the model simulation are displayed in the variable list to the left of the results viewer. A drop down menu allows you to list a single class of variables: Volume, Membrane or User Functions, Region sizes.
</para>

<para>
Data Value Range: 
<imgReference target = "SimResultsDataRange.png"/>
</para>
<para>
Auto Range:
Select to have the software automatically adjust the image display pixel intensities based on the minimum 
and maximum data values for the selected time point. The intensities are automatically converted to and 
displayed as concentrations.
</para>

<para>Min/Max:
Deselect Auto Range and type in the value(s) for the
minimum and/or maximum; press enter to accept the values and to update the image display.
</para>

<para>Color:
View the image data either in Grayscale or in a Blue-Red color map where colors are mapped according 
to concentration. At times some values will be displayed in colors other than the selected color map 
because they do not fall within the specified range.
</para>
<para>
Color Value:

<para>BM:
Below minimum color</para>

AM:
