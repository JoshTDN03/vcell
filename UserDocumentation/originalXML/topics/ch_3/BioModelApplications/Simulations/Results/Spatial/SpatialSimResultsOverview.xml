<page title="Spatial Simulation Results Overview">

	
	<introduction>
	Simulation solvers producing 1,2 or 3 dimensional spatial domain results are viewed with the Spatial Results Viewer.  
	Controls are provided for selecting variable, time-point, slice-plane, color scaling, region-of-interest (ROI), data plots and statistics.  
	Volume data are displayed as orthogonal slices and membrane data are displayed as surface renderings.  
	A pointer can be used to interactively find data values on single mesh points.  
	Collections of data can be exported in various formats.  
	Pre-defined simulation statistics and protocol image views are also available depending on user settings.
