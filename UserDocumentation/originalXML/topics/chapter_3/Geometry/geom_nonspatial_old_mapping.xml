<page title="Structure Mapping for Legacy Non-Spatial Geometries">

	
	<introduction>
	VCell models previously used surface to volume ratios and volume fractions to describe the compartment sizes, Vcell now uses absolute sizes to describe the sizes of each compartment.  
	Below is a description of structure mapping values for these legacy models.
	</introduction>

	<para>
	 
	For some older models, the values in the "size" column will not exist, enter a size for 1 of the compartments and VCell will automatically calculate the others from the surface to volume ratios and volume factions.  
	Once the size has been entered, the table will report either the size ratio of volume compartment to the parent compartment in which it is contained (volume:volume) column, 
	or the ratio of a membrane compartment surface to the total enclosed volume (surface:volume).  These two columns cannot be edited.
