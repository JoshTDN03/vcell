<page title="Creating image-based geometries in VCell">

	
	<introduction>
	Image-based geometries are created in VCell using the Image Geometry Editor, which is accessible from both BioModel and MathModel workspaces. 
	The Editor includes tools for constructing irregular geometries manually or from images obtained outside the VCell environment (e.g. digital microscopy).

	<para>
	The overall segmentation process generally begins by clicking the "Add ROI..." button (see (B) in figure) to add an ROI name for each subdomain (compartment) in the final geometry.  
	The user enters an ROI name and a color is assigned that will be used to paint changes onto the editing canvas when user actions occur.  
	When working with an imported image, the user can crop it to select the appropriate working area (D) and adjust brightness and magnification (C) to clearly display the image before defining ROIs. 
	This is illustrated by the  first two frames in the series of snapshots at the bottom of figure that demonstrates, stage by stage, how an uploaded noisy image is transformed into a model geometry. 
	In the example figure, two spatial compartments are represented by the two corresponding ROIs.
	</para>
	<para>
	 Images that are not pre-segmented often require "smoothing" (blurring) in order to reduce random intensity variations (noise), which otherwise might make thresholding of image intensities less effective.  
	 The smoothing function, located under the "Tools..." popup menu, applies a filter to the imported image that reduces random noise (E).  
	 If after smoothing the image retains sufficient clarity and definition, the histogram thresholding tool can be applied to select intensity values that will define the currently active ROI (F). 
	 This tool allows the user to quickly paint the editing canvas at appropriate locations in all z-slices.  
	 Manual painting can be used to add, clean up or enhance ROIs after applying the histogram tool on an imported image or when the user is creating irregular geometry without an imported image (G).  
	 The final step in the segmentation process is to apply the "Resolve regions..." tool under the "Tools..." popup menu. 
	 This tool calculates the identity, size and location of all contiguous ROIs that have so far been defined in the editing canvas and provides a clear view of the current editing state (H).  
	 Without the resolve regions view, it would be difficult to detect small discrepancies in ROI editing, which may lead to a fragmented or inappropriate final geometry unintended by the user.  
	 The histogram threshold tool (F), manual paint (G) and resolve regions (H) can be repeated as necessary to create all the ROIs that are appropriate for the desired geometry.  
	 Clicking the "Finish" button completes the process of transforming the editing canvas into a valid VCell geometry while allowing the user a chance to continue editing if any errors are encountered. Below, 
	 the tools for histogram thresholding and resolving regions are described in more details.
	</para>
	<para>
	The histogram thresholding tool (F) helps segment an imported image by grouping areas of an image on the basis of their pixel values (a histogram of image intensities will appear below the image geometry editing canvas (J)). 
	This tool is especially helpful when the imported image files have multiple image z-slices  representing three-dimensional (3D) information.  
	Manual segmentation of 3D images is tedious and difficult, given that only one z-slice can be viewed at a time. 
	Thresholding of image values is usually effective because structurally related areas of the imported image have close pixel values since they are created similarly during the image generation process (e.g. microscope images from cells stained to enhance cytoplasm or nucleus).  
	Clicking or dragging the mouse horizontally across the histogram display selects a range of pixel values throughout an imported image, that, grouped together, define a portion corresponding to the currently active ROI.  
	Histogram selections are highlighted in the editing canvas and can be applied permanently (painted) by pressing the "Set ROI..." button  (K).
	</para>
	<para>
	The "Resolve regions" tool is activated by clicking "Resolve regions..." in the Tools..." popup menu and displays a list of all contiguous ROI regions (objects) and their immediate neighbors which are currently �painted� in the editing canvas.  
	Thresholding and manual editing often leave ROI objects in the editing canvas that are inappropriate. 
	The resolved regions list allows the user to select one or more ROI objects and merge them with a neighbor. 
	A neighbor is an ROI object immediately adjacent to (touching) another ROI object in the editing canvas. 
	Thus, merging allows the user to effectively paint several discrete areas of the editing canvas at once, by selecting from a list and pressing "Merge selected with neighbor".  
	It replaces (overwrites) the selected ROI object paint value with its neighbor ROI paint value.  
	Depending on the selections made in the resolve regions list, merging can add or remove ROI paint throughout the editing canvas in one easy operation. 
	</para>
	<para>
	The "origin" and "size" of the geometry can be edited by clicking the "Attributes..." button.  The "origin" defines where the first defined geometry point exists in simulation world space.
	The "size" defines the total length of the geometry in each axis (XYZ) in simulation world space.  The length can be entered per image pixel or total.
	The origin and size can also be set after the geometry is finished and applied to an application. (Application->Geometry Definition->Edit Domain... ) (described elsewhere).
