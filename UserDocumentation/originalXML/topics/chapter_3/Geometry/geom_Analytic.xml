<page title="Creating analytic geometries in VCell">

	
	<introduction>
	Analytic geometry is defined by one or more boolean functions of x, y and z in the spatial domain.
	The Analytic Geometry Editor, accessible from the geometry view of a BioModel application or MathModel, provides an interface for entering 1, 2, or 3 dimensional boolean functions.

	The size of the overall range over which x, y, z coordinates are generated (the domain) is set by clicking the “Change domain” button.
	The origin (minimum) x, y, z spatial geometry coordinates are entered as well as the size (length) of each geometry dimension.
	Functions are entered by clicking the “Add Subdomain…” button.
	The functions define points in the overall geometry where each subdomain is to be assigned.
	Simple definitions are provided for commonly used analytic function shapes or functions can be entered completely manually.
	The simple definitions (e.g. circle) can be used as is or are useful as templates for more complicated shapes.
	Simple definitions require the user to enter only a few parameters (e.g. center and radius) that define a particular shape.
	Clicking “Add New Subdomain” places the current function definition at the top of the subdomain table list.
	Selected function entries can be moved within the list by pressing the “front” or “back” buttons.
	The overall analytic geometry is created from the subdomain list by evaluating each function at values of x, y, z starting at the bottom of the list.
	Non-zero function values at a particular x, y, z coordinate mark a point in the geometry as being part of that function’s subdomain.
	Non-zero subdomain values that come from functions higher in the table list functions replace any previous subdomain values as the evaluation proceeds.
	A display of the overall geometry defined by the current set of subdomain functions is displayed below the table list.
