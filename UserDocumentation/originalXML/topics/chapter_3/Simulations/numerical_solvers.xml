	<introduction>
	The Virtual Cell converts the biological description defined in a BioModel into a corresponding mathematical system of equations (e.g. ordinary and/or partial differential equations), 
	VCell will then solve the equations by applying numerical solvers to perform and analyze simulations. 
	</introduction>
	
	<operation>
	In Virtual Cell, numerical solvers can be divided into the following 4 types.

	<item>Deterministic Compartmental Solvers</item>
	The compartmental simulation executes a single point simulation based on the defined physiological model, the geometric assumptions, and structure sizes or surface to volume ratios and
	volume fractions. The ordinary differential equations (ODE), for single point approximations, representing the reactions kinetics are generated and passed to an interpreted ODE solver.
	The set of nonlinear ODE equations are typically solved in seconds. It allows an interactive modification 
	of parameters and a quick determination of the effect over time. In addition, the Virtual Cell software computes the local sensitivity (Sensitivity Analysis) of any species concentration 
	to any parameter as a function of time evaluated at the nominal solution.
