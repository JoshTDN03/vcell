	<introduction> 
	<para>Output functions are user defined observables for simulation results in a biomodel application or in a math model, 
	and they are saved with the model and available for viewing in all simulations in containing application or math model.</para> 
	
	<para>Output functions are defined as vcell expressions. Symbols that can be used in the expression of a output function are:</para>	
	<list>
	<item>t</item>
	<item>x, y, z : spatial models only</item>
	<item>model variables</item>
	<item>vcell predefined mathematical functions</item>
	<item>previously defined output functions</item>
	</list>
	<para>After an output function is added, it will be automatically added to all simulation result viewers.</para>
	
	<para>
	In spatial models, output functions are defined in a specific subdomain, either in a volume or on a membrane. This determines the function type of a output function. 
	In subdomains where a output function is not define, Gray color will be displayed with "Undefined" as the value in results viewer.  	
	</para>

	<list>	
	<item>Add Function</item>
	
	In an non-spatial application or math model, click "Add Function" button to add a output function.
	After editing the name and expression, click "OK" to add the function.

	<para>In a spatial application or math model, click "Add Function" button to add a output function.
	After selecting a subdomain, editing the name and expression, click "OK" to add the function.

	</para>
	
	<item>Delete Function</item>
	Select a function in the table, click "Delete Function" button to delete a function.	
	
	<item>Edit Expression</item>	
	After a function is added, expression can be changed by double clicking the expression column.
