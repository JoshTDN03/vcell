<introduction>The kymograph tab, which displays line scans over time,
will become active on the results panel once a line is
drawn over the image data. The kymograph dialog displays the data in a visual image format where the distance of the line is plotted against time as well as in a multiple graph format. Two graphs dis- play the concentration of the selected variable plotted over distance and over time. These plots will update according to the position of the crosshair, which is created with the mouse, in the image data panel. In addition, each graph has a mouse menu feature for additional plot settings, see above.
