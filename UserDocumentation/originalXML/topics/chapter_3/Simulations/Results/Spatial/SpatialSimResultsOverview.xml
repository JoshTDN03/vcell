	In the Simulation Results Viewer there are three options selected by tabs
	<list>
	<item> <link target = "SimResSpatialSliceView">View Data</link> </item>
	<item> <link target = "ExportingSimResults">Export Results</link> </item>
<!--

    	</list>

	<para>
The image data from spatial simulations are displayed in the results dialog. You can also generate a Spatial Plot, using defined regions, a Time Plot, using points, or a Kymograph, which displays a line scan over time.
     </para>

The Simulation Results Viewer has three tabs: View Data, Export Data and Post Processing Results. The following sections describe functions within the View Data tab.

The image data from spatial simulations are displayed in the results dialog. You can also generate a Spatial Plot, using defined regions, a Time Plot, using points, or a Kymograph, which displays a line scan over time.

	<para>Time: The data time point that is displayed. Enter a value in the text field or click once on the selection arrow. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to select a time point. The image will update when the time point is changed.
</para>
<para>
All Variables: 
All Variables from the model simulation are displayed in the variable list to the left of the results viewer. A drop down menu allows you to list a single class of variables: Volume, Membrane or User Functions, Region sizes.
</para>

<para>
Data Value Range: 
<imgReference target = "SimResultsDataRange.png"/>
</para>
<para>
Auto Range:
Select to have the software automatically adjust the image display pixel intensities based on the minimum 
and maximum data values for the selected time point. The intensities are automatically converted to and 
displayed as concentrations.
</para>

<para>Min/Max:
Deselect Auto Range and type in the value(s) for the
minimum and/or maximum; press enter to accept the values and to update the image display.
</para>

<para>Color:
View the image data either in Grayscale or in a Blue-Red color map where colors are mapped according 
to concentration. At times some values will be displayed in colors other than the selected color map 
because they do not fall within the specified range.
</para>
<para>
