Drawing Tools:
<imgReference target = "SimResultsDrawingTools.png"/>
</para>
<para>
Selection, Creating Regions of Interest (ROI):
Choose from selection arrow, point, line, spline or add an additional control point. The line and points are gray when deselected; control nodes and points are white when selected. Use the line or spline tools to create a ROI by clicking to drop nodes and create an enclosed region. For data associated with ROI, see Statistics.
</para>
<para>
Line tool -- Enables show spatial plot button which displays values of the selected variable along the line created with two successive clicks of the line tool.
 </para>
<para>Spline/Curve tool -- Creates a region of interest along the line and enables show spatial plot button. which displays values of the selected variable parametrically by distance along a spline curve defined by two or more successive clicks of the curve tool.
</para><para>
Deleting Points, Lines, or Curves</para>
<para>
Use the selection tool to select the item and then use either Backspace or the Delete key to delete it.
</para><para>Image Zoom:
Use the image zoom feature to ease in
the selection of lines and/or points. Select the Magnification icon and press your left mouse button while you move the mouse across the image to
increase and decrease the image zoom. Alternatively you
can press the alt key and drag the mouse across the image to zoom up or down.</para>
<para>Pan Tool:
Use the pan tool, while the image is zoomed up, to move across the image. With the Hand icon depressed, hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse across the image to move it.
</para>
<para>Slice
View 3-D data sets by using the Plus (+1/10) and Minus (-1/10) buttons to step through the series.</para>
<para>
Axis
The Axis is provided as an additional means of viewing your 3-D image data.</para>

<para>
Spatial plot of variables:Spatial plots button becomes active once you use the line or spline tools to define a region. Select the region and then press Spatial plot which displays values of the selected variable parametrically by dis- tance along a line or spline curve defined by two or more successive clicks of either tool. The graph is interactive; as you move the mouse over the graph, the coordinates are displayed in the bottom left corner.
    </para>
<para>
Toggle Plot/Values Display: Once plots are generated the results can be displayed as graphs or a table of data values (see <link target = "SimCompartmentResults">compartment results viewer</link>).
</para>
<para>
Time Plot: This will become active when you use the point tool to define a point or series of points. Press Time plot to view the graph of the selected point(s). Points are listed in the top left corner of the Time Plot frame and plotted as indi- vidual data series for each variable. The initially selected variable will be plotted over time for each point. Use the variable list to plot multiple variables for each point.
</para>
<para>
Toggle Plot/Values Display:Once plots are generated the results can be displayed as graphs or a table of data values (see <link target = "SimCompartmentResults">compartment results viewer</link>).
</para>
<para>
Kymograph: The <link target = "SimResultsKymograph"> kymograph tab </link>, which displays line scans over time,
will become active on the results panel once a line is
drawn over the image data. 
</para>
<para>
Export Data: Export feature for data. See <link target = "ExportingSimResults"> Export</link> for more information.
</para>
<para>


<link target = "SimResultsSpatialSurfaceView"> 3D Membrane Surface Viewer: </link> The 3D Membrane Surface Viewer allows users to view, manipulate and pick values interactively from the membrane data of 3D spatial simulation results. The 3D Membrane Surface Viewer allows views of the data from any viewpoint around an X,Y,Z coordinate system. The view can be changed easily using the mouse (See Changing views below).
