Drawing Tools:
<imgReference target = "SimResultsDrawingTools.png"/>
</para>
<para>
Selection, Creating Regions of Interest (ROI):
Choose from selection arrow, point, line, spline or add an additional control point. The line and points are gray when deselected; control nodes and points are white when selected. Use the line or spline tools to create a ROI by clicking to drop nodes and create an enclosed region. For data associated with ROI, see Statistics.
</para>
<para>
Line tool -- Enables show spatial plot button which displays values of the selected variable along the line created with two successive clicks of the line tool.
 </para>
<para>Spline/Curve tool -- Creates a region of interest along the line and enables show spatial plot button. which displays values of the selected variable parametrically by distance along a spline curve defined by two or more successive clicks of the curve tool.
</para><para>
Deleting Points, Lines, or Curves</para>
<para>
Use the selection tool to select the item and then use either Backspace or the Delete key to delete it.
</para><para>Image Zoom:
Use the image zoom feature to ease in
the selection of lines and/or points. Select the Magnification icon and press your left mouse button while you move the mouse across the image to
increase and decrease the image zoom. Alternatively you
can press the alt key and drag the mouse across the image to zoom up or down.</para>
<para>Pan Tool:
Use the pan tool, while the image is zoomed up, to move across the image. With the Hand icon depressed, hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse across the image to move it.
</para>
<para>Slice
View 3-D data sets by using the Plus (+1/10) and Minus (-1/10) buttons to step through the series.</para>
<para>
Axis
The Axis is provided as an additional means of viewing your 3-D image data.</para>

Spatial plot of variables:Spatial plots button becomes active once you use the line or spline tools to define a region. Select the region and then press Spatial plot which displays values of the selected variable parametrically by dis- tance along a line or spline curve defined by two or more successive clicks of either tool. The graph is interactive; as you move the mouse over the graph, the coordinates are displayed in the bottom left corner.
    </para>
<para>
Toggle Plot/Values Display: Once plots are generated the results can be displayed as graphs or a table of data values. Views and functions in plots and tables are controlled in the same way as simulation results from Compartmental models.
</para>
<para>
Time Plot: This will become active when you use the point tool to define a point or series of points. Press Time plot to view the graph of the selected point(s). Points are listed in the top left corner of the Time Plot frame and plotted as indi- vidual data series for each variable. The initially selected variable will be plotted over time for each point. Use the variable list to plot multiple variables for each point.
</para>

Toggle Plot/Values Display:Once plots are generated the results can be displayed as graphs or a table of data values. Views and functions in plots and tables are controlled in the same way as simulation results from Compart- mental models.

<para>
Kymograph: The <link target = "SimResultsKymograph"> kymograph tab </link>, which displays line scans over time,
will become active on the results panel once a line is
drawn over the image data. 
</para>
<para>
Export Data: Export feature for data. See Export [LINK GOES HERE] for more information.
</para>
<para>
3D Membrane Surface Viewer: The 3D Membrane Surface Viewer allows users to view, manipulate and pick values interactively from the membrane data of 3D spatial simulation results. The 3D Membrane Surface Viewer allows views of the data from any viewpoint around an X,Y,Z coordinate system. The view can be changed easily using the mouse (See Changing views below).
</para>
<para>
Membrane Surfaces Viewer: The Membrane Surface Viewer is accessed via the Simulation Results Viewer when a Membrane vari- able is selected from the list of variable names. The "Show Membrane Surfaces" button is then active at the bottom of the Simulation Results Viewer. The Membrane Surface Viewer is initialized with the color scaling and data values for the current membrane variable name and time point chosen in the Simulation Results Viewer.
</para>
<para>
Synchronize Display Parameters: When the Membrane Surface Viewer has been activated the "Show Membrane Surfaces" button text on the Simulation Results Viewer will change to "Update Membrane Surfaces". This button may be pressed at any time to synchronize the display parameters of the Membrane Surface Viewer to the current display parameters of the Simulation Results Viewer. The parameters include variable, time and color scaling. When the Membrane Surface Viewer is closed (click on X in upper right corner) the window will disappear but the current view and pick info settings will not be lost.
</para>
<para>
Changing views
</para>
<list>

<item>
ROTATE: 
The view may be rotated arbitrarily using a "trackball" interface by dragging the mouse with the left mouse button (leftMB) pressed. The view rotates as if the mouse were attached to a sphere containing the surfaces. The amount of possible rotation depends on where the mouse is when the leftMB is first pressed and the direction of drag.
</item>
<item>
MOVE: 
The view may also be moved side to side and up or down by dragging the mouse with the right
mouse button (rightMB) pressed.
</item>
<item>
ZOOM: 
The view can also be zoomed closer or farther away by dragging the mouse with the left and
right mouse buttons (leftMB-rightMB) pressed.
</item>
<item>
Retrieve INFO: 
To retrieve Info for the simulation data value at a particular membrane location, hold the control key on the keyboard down while clicking the leftMB. The data value will appear in red along with the centroid coordinate of the membrane patch under the mouse pick.
</item>
<item>
HOME: 
A preset "HOME" view (button in the window upper left) is provided to allow users to reset their
view to a default perspective.
</item>
</list>
<para>
Bounding Box
The bounding box (checkbox in the window upper left) can be turned on and off to show where
membranes surfaces are located with respect to the entire simulation data volume.
</para>

<para>
Surface Table
All membrane surfaces are listed in the viewer's table.
</para>

<list>
<item>
Name: Name of the membrane.
</item>
<item>
Size: Membrane surface area given in square microns.
</item>
<item>
Visible: Checkbox in "visible" column allows the user to turn on and of the viewing of surfaces. Making a particular surface invisible allows for viewing interior surfaces that would otherwise be ob- scured.
</item>
<item>
Wireframe: 
Checkbox in "wireframe" column allows the user to produce an outline of each simulation mesh
volume element. The resulting outline is only a gross approximation of the actual computa- tional surface used to generate the simulation data.
</item>
<item>
Transparent: 
Listbox in "transparent" column allows users to select any other value than "none" so that the surface will be displayed allowing any underlying surfaces to also be visible. The larger the number selected, the more any underlying surfaces will show through on the display.
</item>
