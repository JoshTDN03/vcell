	<introduction>The Post Processing panel, accessed as a tab in 3D simulation results, gives access to derivative information from result data sets such as average values of spatial variables within a compartment over time and simulated "microscope" images derived from 3D data through Z-projections or gaussian convolution.</introduction>

	<operations><para> <bold>Post Processing Variable Statistics:</bold> To view one or more compartmental average values of varables, select the variable names in the list and a graph of values over time will appear in the right hand pane. The data in tabular form can be accessed by clicking the spreadsheet icon at the lower right of the graph pane, and toggled back to graphical form with the adjacent graph icon.  Note, to select multiple variables, press the Control key while clicking on variable name of interest.

	<bold>Post Process Image Data:</bold> If a point spread function for one or more flourescence functions was selected in the <link target = "MicroscopeMeasurement">Microscope Measurements</link> tab under Application <link target = "ProtocolsOverview">Protocols</link> (prior to running a simulation), computed images for each flourescent function can be selected from the list under the PostProcess Image Data label.  The image will appear in the pane to the right.  At the lower left is a time slider.  In the case of Z Projections, a single two dimensional image is produced.  For gaussian convolution, a slider at the lower right of the panel allows one to browse through Z slices.
