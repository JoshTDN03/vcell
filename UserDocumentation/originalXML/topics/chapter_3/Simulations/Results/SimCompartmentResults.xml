Simulation displays results as a graph (Plot) or a table of the values (Values). Use the toggle buttons to switch between Plot and Values views. The default view is Plot of a single variable from the model on the Y axis against time on the X axis. Results from Stochastic multi-trial simulations are displayed as a histogram.
