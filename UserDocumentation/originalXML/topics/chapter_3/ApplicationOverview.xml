Applications allow users to define the quantitative 
conditions needed to define, run and visualize a
Virtual Experiment, i.e. numerical simulation. 
The Application is the component in which the mapping between the model and 
the geometry can be established, define the Specifications (species, reactions)
and Protocols (events, electric). When you create an Application, you 
create either a Deterministic or Stochastic
model.

The Application directory displays the Applications associated with the BioModel. 
You can expand the tree to display the
Geometry , Specifications, Protocols, Simulations, Parameter Estimation.
