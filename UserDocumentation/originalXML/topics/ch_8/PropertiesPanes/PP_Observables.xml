	<introduction>
	The observables properties tree on a left allows editing of the Observable name, 
	adding/editing/deleting sites and site states. Right pane is uneditable and provides real-time updates 
	of the observable composition.

	<item>Each Observable consists of one or more <bold>Species Patters</bold> that 
	define common features of species selected by Observable.</item>
	<item>Each SpeciesPattern consists of one or more of Molecules (connected through explicit bonds). </item>
	<item>Sites that have specified state are shown in green with state shown
	underneath the site shape.</item> 
	<item>Sites may have defined binding - they can be explicitly bound to another site, 
	declared unbound or declared bound to unspecified site - then the site is shown in green with bond (if exists) 
	shown in solid color.</item>
	<item>Site than can be in any state and can be bound or unbound is shown in white, with possible bond shown 
	in grey as a question mark.</item>

	<item>Observable name: Right click to add Species Pattern (species with a given set of features).</item>
	<item>Species Pattern: Right click to delete Pattern or Add Molecules that constitute pattern.</item>
	<item>Molecule is added with all sites being in unspecified state (white). Right click on a 
	site to choose a state and specify bond - a site can be connected to any other site in a species pattern, 
	or be declared bound or unbound.</item>
