	<introduction>
	Network-free application is designed to allow simulation of requested quantities (<link target="Observables">Observables</link>) and
	initially specified (<link target="Species">species</link>) without the generatipon of a network. In cases when the model generated by
	rules may have an infinite network (such as in filaments) but the number of particles is rather small, this type of application allows
	a model to make predictions about timecourses of quantities of interest.

	Using NFSim, please be aware of:
		<list>
			<item>While it can be used for every model obeying limitations below, it is designed to be used to simulate rule-based models.</item>
			<item>This is stochastic simulation, so simulation results will vary by run.</item>
			<item>It operates with particles, so copying deterministic application as NFSim may lead to very large number of particles.
				This number can be adjusted by changing simulation volume in 
				<link target="geom_nonspatial_mapping">structure size</link> setting.</item>
			<item>The user may not be able to see what species are populated during simulation. To test if reaction rules produce expected
				species and reactions, the user is advised to generate deterministic rule-based application 
				and test <link target="NetworkSpecifications">network properties</link>. </item>
		</list>
		 
	 Using NFSim application has the following limitations: 
	 <list> 
	<item>The model must have a single compartment</item>
	<item>All reactions and reaction rules must have mass-action kinetics only</item> 
	<item>The number of particles for participating species is limited: the default is 200,000 (it may be increased in
		<link target = "NFSimSimulationEditor">NFSim Simulation Editor</link>).
