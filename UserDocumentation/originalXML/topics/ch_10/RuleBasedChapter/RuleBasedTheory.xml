	<introduction>
	<para>A rule-based model is specified as a set of <link target = "ReactionRules">reaction rules</link>, which are
	associated with specific rate laws. Given a set of seed <link target = "CompositeSpecies">species</link>, 
	a <link target = "ReactionRules">reaction rule</link> identifies
	those species that have the features required to undergo the transformation from
	reactants to products specified in the reaction rule. Interactions represented in a
	reaction rule do not depend on features not explicitly indicated. Thus, multiple
	species may qualify as reactants in a type of reaction defined by a reaction rule.</para>
	
	<para>The modeler can define which components and modifications of a <link target = "Molecules">molecule</link> or
	molecular assembly affect a particular chemical transformation, and which do not.
	Furthermore, the modeler has the ability to account for steric clashes, cooperativity,
	and any other factors that might influence the rate of a reaction. A reaction rule can
	state, for example, that “any cell-surface monomeric receptor having an available
	extracellular binding site and any free extracellular ligand can interact and form
	a ligand–receptor complex; the probability of this interaction depends only on
	the total numbers of cell-surface monomeric receptors and extracellular ligands
	and does not depend on the specific state of the receptor cytosolic portion.” In
	this example, we assume that the cytoplasmic state of a receptor does not affect
	ligand–receptor binding, which implies that to parameterize all reactions specified
	by the ligand–receptor interaction rule, we need just two rate constants: on and
	off rates.</para>
