	<introduction> 
The Virtual Cell Software version 5.4 for the first time provides an integrated environment to 
introduce <def target= "def_RuleBased">rule-based</def> features in the VCell interface alongside familiar species and reaction concepts. 
The new parts of <link target = "PhysOverview">Physiology</link> specifications include 
<link target = "Molecules">Molecules</link> and <link target = "Observables">Observables</link>, 
as well as <link target = "ReactionRules">Reaction Rules</link> that are specified alongside 
<link target = "Reactions">reactions</link> in a <link target = "ReactTabView">Reactions Editor</link>.
 
<para><bold>Rule-based features and compartments</bold></para>
Defining <link target = "Molecules">Molecules</link> allow the user to create rule-based models. 
However, <bold>rule-based models may exist in a single compartment only</bold> 
(this is a temporary restrictions that will be lifted in the next release).  Once a molecule is created, 
any new species by default will be placed in c0 compartment, and this can not be changed. Vice versa, if multiple compartments 
are created, no molecules can be added.

<para><bold>Mixing Rule-based features and reaction networks</bold></para>
As with a regular BioModel, a rule-based BioModel consists of a model description (Physiology), 
and one or more Applications. Except for a limitation of a single compartment, 
any operations with ordinary species and reactions are supported in VCell alongside rules. Specifically, 
species that are used as initial seed species for rule-based models can be used as species in reaction networks.


	<para><bold>Rule-based Applications</bold></para>
	Each <link target = "ApplicationOverview">BioModel Application</link> 
	allows the user to define the  quantitative conditions needed to define, 
	run and visualize numerical simulation.  A Rule-Based BioModel may have numerous 
	Applications, including <def target="def_Deterministic">deterministic</def>, 
	<def target="def_Stochastic">stochastic</def> and <def target="def_NetworkFree">network-free</def>.  
	Each Application, in turn can have multiple Simulations, in which different numerical
	methods or conditions are used.

	<para><bold>Rule-Based MathModel</bold></para>
	MathModel for <def target="def_Deterministic">deterministic</def> or 
	<def target="def_Stochastic">stochastic</def> applications generated for the rule-based model 
	have a standard VCell structure with the full list of species and reactions, observables
	given by functions. MathModel for <def target="def_NetworkFree">network-free</def> application has a new syntax.
