  The reaction rules editor pane is currently the only way to specify and edit a reaction rule.

  The top of the table shows the cartoon of the reaction rule. Cartoon is for illustration purpose only
  and non-clickable. The bottom of the pane serves as o create a reaction rule, one has to specify

    <para>
    <bold>Edit the reaction name</bold> using the text field. A name already given to another reaction will be rejected.
    </para>
    <para>
    <bold>Select a rate law</bold> using the combobox to select one of a few predefined rate laws 
    (mass action, Michaelis-Menten reversible and irreversible) in micromolar per second or to enter a user-defined 
    rate law, either in micromolar per second or in molecules per second. 
    </para>
    <para>
    <bold>Convert the rate law</bold> from micromolar per second to molecules per second, or vice versa, using the 
    <bold>Convert to</bold> button. Note that predefined laws are only in micromolar per second, so if they are converted 
    to molecules per second, the user-defined kinetic law will automatically be selected, and remain so even if converted back.
    </para>
    <para>
    <bold> Edit Expressions and their units</bold> in the Expression column.  
    <list>
    <item>Predefined rate laws, species concentrations and universal constants cannot be edited.</item> 
    <item>Incompatible units will be silently rejected.</item> 
    <item>If references to new terms are added, new rows will automatically be added for these terms.  An expression for each new
    term must be added in the expression column</item> 
    <item>Terms can be set to <def target = "def_Global">global</def> or <def target = "def_Local">local</def> using a 
    checkbox, except for the reaction rate, which is always local.  Species concentrations and universal constants 
    are always global.</item> 
	</list>
	
    <bold> Add Annotations</bold> in the Annotation text field, which can be shown or hiddenby selecting the plus or minus 
    sign next to the <bold>Add Annotation Here</bold>.text.  Annotations apply to the entire reaction.
