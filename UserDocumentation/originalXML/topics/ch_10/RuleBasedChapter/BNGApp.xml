	<para>Rule-based models can be simulated using <def target="def_Deterministic">deterministic</def> or 
	<def target="def_Stochastic">stochastic</def> (<def target="def_RuleBased">rule-based</def>) applications
	using the <def target="def_BioNetGen">BioNetGen</def> network-generation
	algorithm to generate the complete network of species and reactions.</para>
	 
	<para>This network is obtained by applying the set of reaction rules to the set of specified composite species. Initial amounts
	of composite species used as seed species are defined in <link target = "NetworkSpecifications">Network</link> specification tab.
	<link target = "NetworkSpecifications">Network</link> specification parameters are used to control the size of the network,
	which otherwise can become infinite. The generated species and reactions can be seen in 
	<link target = "NetworkSpecifications">Network</link> tab, but not added to the 
	<link target = "ReactDiagView">Reaction Diagram</link> view. </para>
	
	<para>After the user is satified with the network that is generated using the set of species and reaction rules,
		he/she can run regular determiministic or stochastic <link target = "simulations_overview">simulations</link>.</para>
