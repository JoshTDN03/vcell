	<introduction>
	<bold>Species</bold> are used to create variables (molecular species) in <def target = "def_reactions">reactions</def> and fluxes and can exist in both <def target = "def_membranes">  membranes </def> and 
 	<def target = "def_compartments"> volume compartments </def> (volumes). 
 	Species are unique pools of molecules within a single structure; if the same species is copied to a different 
 	structure, the structure name is appended to the species name to retain a unique identifier, e.g. species_structure. A species is depicted in the <link target = "ReactDiagView">Reaction Diagram</link> as a green shape.
 	
 	<para>In <def target = "def_RuleBased">rule-based models</def>, molecular details must be specified for all species.  Species are composed of <link target = "Molecules">molecules</link> with bonds that connect
	binding sites. If the molecule has multiple states, each state of the molecule (at each site) must be specified - otherwise the species would represent a pool of different chemical entities and would not be valid. Species with molecular details can be used in any reaction networt.  In rule-based models a species serves as a seed species when
	<def target= "def_RuleBased">rule-based</def> models: they are either used as starting set of species to 
	generating a network (using <def target= "def_BioNetGen">BioNetGen</def>), or is used as part of an initial set
	of species for stochastic <def target= "def_NetworkFree">network-free</def> simulations performed using the  
	(using <def target= "def_NFSim">NFSim</def> solver).</para>

	<para>The Species Tab has several columns:</para>
	<list> 
		<item>The species <bold>Name</bold>.  For new species it will be s_number. For imported BNGL this name is autogenerated. 
			The user may change name right in the column.</item> 
			<item>the <def target = "def_structure"> structure </def> 
				that contains the species.</item>
			<item>  If the species is linked to a pathway object, a <bold>Link</bold> to that object will be shown in the Link column.  Mousing over a link will open a tooltip box with additional information about the linked object. 
				Double click on that link to navigate to the Pathway Diagram and 
				highlight the object linked to the species.</item>
			<item><bold>Depiction</bold> shows the structure of the species. Species without molecular details appear as green shapes.  Molecular details of species appear as differently colored shapes, depicting each molecule that 
				comprises the species,connect by bonds.  Sites having states marked by yellow dot. States of sites are omitted for clarity.</item>
			<item><bold>BioNetGen Definition</bold> provides a BNGL string for species with molecular detail. The two ends of the same bond will have the same color font. This field is cannot be edited but is searchable.</item></list>
