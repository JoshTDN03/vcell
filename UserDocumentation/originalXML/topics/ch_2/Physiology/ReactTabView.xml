	<introduction>
	A table of reactions can be used to create and edit <def target = "def_reactions">structure </def>, 
	membrane fluxes and <def target = "def_ReactionRules">reaction rules</def>.
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>

	The Reactions Tab has several columns:
	<list> 
		<item><bold>Reaction</bold> column specifies either editable reaction or flux, 
		or uneditable "Reaction Rule" text. </item> 
		<item><bold>Name</bold> column has a sortable name that is autogenerated as r_number but can be edited.</item> 
		<item><def target = "def_structure">structure </def> where reaction, flux or reaction rule takes place. 
			For rule-based models, this field is uneditable, as the model may contain only one compartment.</item>
		<item><bold>Depiction</bold> shows the molecular details of the reactants and products. If species does not have 
		molecular details, it is shown as green shape. For reactions, species with molecular
		details must be already specified in the <link target = "SpeciesTabView">Species</link> tab. For reaction rules, 
		reactant and product patterns must be specified below in <link target = "PP_ReactionRulesEditor"> Reaction Rules Properties</link> pane. 
		Green color for sites of species with moledcular details denote that either binding or state specified, 
		white sites are undefined and can be connected to anything or be
			in multiple states (if yellow shape is shown). States of sites are omitted for clarity.</item>
		<item><bold>Kinetics</bold> can be selected here and specified in properties pane below. For reaction rules,
		the only is allowable kinetics is mass Action and is currently uneditable.</item>
		<item><bold>BioNetGen Definition</bold> provides BNGL string with rule encoding. It
			is uneditable but searchable.</item>
		<item><bold>Link</bold> does not work for reaction rules at this time.</item>
	</list>

	 <para>The bottom pane of the window displays a <link target = "PP_Reactions">Reaction Properties Pane</link>,
	or <link target = "PP_MemFlux"> Membrane Flux property pane</link>, 
	or <link target = "PP_ReactionRulesEditor"> Reaction Rules Properties</link> pane, depending on the current selection. </para>
	</appearance>
	
	<operations>
	<bold>New Reaction</bold> adds a new reaction or flux. If there are multiple compartments, in the popup box select the structure
	where the reaction occurs, define a name for the reaction and type the reaction using the format "a+b->c" 
	where a and b, etc. are reactants and c, etc are products. Numbers before a species name are used to indicate 
	stoichiometry.   If a, b, etc have not been defined, they are automatically created as species within the 
	structure where the reaction occurs.

	<para><bold>New Rule</bold> adds a new reaction rule. The only way to specify and edit 
		the new rule is via <link target = "PP_ReactionRulesEditor">properties pane</link> below.</para>
		
	<para><bold>Edit</bold> kinetic laws by selecting a row 
	in the table and editing the <link target = "PP_Reactions"> Reaction Properties pane</link>,  
	<link target = "PP_MemFlux"> Flux Properties pane</link> or <link target = "PP_ReactionRulesEditor">Rule Editor</link> as appropriate.</para>  
	<para><bold>Delete</bold> a reaction, flux or rule by selecting a row or rows.</para> 
	<para><bold>Duplicate</bold> will create an exact copy of highlighted rule 
		with a new name oldname_0. This is very useful
		feature when a new rule is a slight modification of the previous one.</para> 
	<para> Use the <link target = "PathLink"> Pathway Links</link> button to match reactions within 
	<def target = "def_pathcom"> Pathway Commons</def> Database.</para>
	<para> <bold>Search</bold> the list of reactions and reaction rules using the Search Box 
		to enter reaction name, structure, or any part of BNGL string.</para>
