	<introduction>
	In BioModels, species are used to define variables (molecular species) in 
	<link target = "Reactions"> reactions and fluxes</link>.  	
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>
	There are two types of species that can be used in BioModel:
	<list>
	<item>Regular <link target = "RegularSpecies">species</link> are defined by a green round shape and 
	define variables.</item>
	<item><link target = "CompositeSpecies">Composite species</link> are defined by a blue round shape and 
	have an internal structure: they are composed of <link target = "Molecules">molecules</link>.
	They can be used as regular species in any reaction network, but they also can serve as seed species in 
	<def target= "def_RuleBased">rule-based</def> models: they are used as starting set of species to either 
	generate a network (using <def target= "def_BioNetGen">BioNetGen</def> software), or used as an initial set
	of species for stochastic <def target= "def_NetworkFree">Network-free</def> simulations performed by 
	(using <def target= "def_NFSim">NFSim</def> software).</item>
