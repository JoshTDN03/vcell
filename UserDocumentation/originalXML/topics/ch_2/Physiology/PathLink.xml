	Selecting a single species or a single reaction in the Reaction Diagram, Reactions Table or 
	Species Table enables a <bold>Pathway Links</bold> button.

	If a species or reaction is already linked to a pathway object, 
	there are multiple ways to see <bold>Linked pathways objects</bold>.

	<item>Double click on the blue underlined link that appears in the <bold>Link</bold> column in the <bold>Reactions</bold> 
	and <bold>Species</bold> tables or under <bold>Linked Pathway Objects</bold> in the <bold>Reaction Diagram</bold>.   
	Annotations and Pathways can be viewed in the Reaction and Species <bold>Object Properties</bold>pane. </item>
	<item>Select <bold>Show Linked Pathway Objects</bold> under the <bold>Pathway Links</bold> menu.</item>

	<bold>/Add or edit Pathway Links.</bold> by selecting <bold>Physiology Links -> Edit Physiology Links...</bold> to initiate a  dialog box with the list of all objects in the Biomodel (physical entities for a species or interactions for a reaction). Create new links or delete existing links by checking/unchecking the checkbox in the table of objects in the dialog box. A Search field is provided for filtering the list of objects.
