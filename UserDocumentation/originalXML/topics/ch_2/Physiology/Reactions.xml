	<link target = "ReactionRules">Reactions rules</link> act on species patterns 
		 (classes of species having same features), thus they define a class of reactions. Individual reactions are
		 generated by applying reactions rules to the set of initial <link target = "Species">species</link>. 
		 They can be seen within Application, but are not displayed in 
		 <link target = "ReactDiagView">Reaction Diagram</link>.
