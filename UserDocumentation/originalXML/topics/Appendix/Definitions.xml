<def target = "def_compartments" defLabel = "Compartments"> A compartment is a volume structure and associated membrane 
structure.  For example, the cyoplasmic compartment would consist of cytosol (a volume structure) and plasma membrane 
(a membrane structure).
</def>


<def target = "def_Deterministic" defLabel = "Deterministic"> A deterministic application uses numerical methods to 
solve for average concentrations over defined areas of space determined by a geometric grid using partial differential 
equations.  A deterministic simulation is valid as long as the concentrations of a simulated population are high. 
However, if the concentrations are very low the biology is more accurately simulated by discrete, stochastic approach.  
"Compartmental" simulations are a special case of deterministic applications where concentrations are assumed to be 
uniform throughout each compartment and thus each compartment is presented by a single point simulation.  Compartmental 
models are not spatially resolved and they are solved using nonlinear ordinary differential equations. These equations are 
generally computed within seconds.
</def> 


<def target = "def_Global" defLabel = "Global Parameter"> A global parameter is identical whereever the term is used.
Changing the parameter is one context will change the parameter where ever it is used.
</def>


<def target = "def_Local" defLabel = "Local Parameter"> A local parameter is unique to the context in which it is used.  A
similar parameter name in a different context will have a unique value.
</def>


<def target = "def_membranes" defLabel = "Membrane"> A membrane is a 2-dimensional structure in a VCell model.  
Species contained within membranes have units of density (number per um squared).  Membrane species may participate 
with volume species in reactions, or reactions may occur only among membrane species.  Membrane flux reactions occur 
within membranes and have reactants and products in the adjacent volume structures.
</def>


<def target = "def_pathcom" defLabel = "Pathway Commons">
Pathway Commons mirrors the content of ten major pathway databases, providing 3,436 pathways including 565,977 
interactions and 116,073 physical entities from 1,295 organisms.
</def>


<def target = "def_prop_pane" defLabel = "Property Pane"> Properties of any selected item are displayed in the 
bottom right pane of the VCell window.  
</def>


<def target = "def_reactions" defLabel = "Reactions"> Reactions are defined by rates of change of reactants and products.
Reactions can involve volume species within a single volume structure, membrane species within a single membrane structure
or they can involved membrane species and volume species of a neighboring volume structure. Reaction kinetics can be
modified by catalysts. Fluxes are a special class of reactions that involve volume species as reactants and volume species within a neighboring volume separate by a
common membrane structure.
</def>


<def target = "def_species" defLabel = "Species"> 
Species are any group of molecules/entities that exist within structures (either membranes or compartments) and 
can be acted upon by reactions or fluxes.  Species are unique to a particular structural class (e.g. cytosol, 
nuclear membrane) for all instances of a given class. Older version of VCell append species context to the given 
name (e..g a species called "Calcium" within "Cytosol" was given the name Calcium_cytoplasm
</def>


<def target = "def_Stochastic" defLabel = "Stochastic"> Stochastic simulations use numerical methods to solve for 
numbers of molecules in a defined region of space using probabilistic methods, where each molecule and event is 
treated individually.  Stochastic simulations are required where concentrations of molecules are very low.
</def>  


<def target = "def_structure" defLabel = "Structure"> A structure in VCell is a spatial element that can have 1,2, or 3 
dimensions.  Structures contain species and reactions,  a three-dimensional structure is a volume and its species have 
units of concentration.  Membranes are two dimensional structures and have units of molecules per micrometer squared.
</def>


<def target = "def_volumes" defLabel = "Volume"> 
A volume in VCell is a 3 dimensional structure.  Species within a volume structure have units of concentration. 
All volume structures except the outermost structure in the topology are bounded by membrane structures.
