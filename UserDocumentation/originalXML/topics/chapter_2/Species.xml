	<introduction>
In BioModels species are used to create variables (molecular species) in <link target = "Reactions"> reactions and fluxes</link>. They can exist in both <def target = "def_membranes">  membranes </def> and <def target = "def_compartments"> compartments </def> (volumes) of the cellular structures. Species are unique pools of molecules within a single compartment. If the same molecular component is present in multiple compartments, the compartment name is appended to the species name to retain a unique identifier, e.g. species_compartment.  	
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>
The Species Tab diplays a table of the species name and the <def target = "target"> structure </def> that contains it.  The <link target = "PP_Species"> Species Properties pane </link> is shown in the bottom right pane
	</appearance>
	
	<operations>
The species name can be edited by highlighting and typing in either the tabular view or within the properties pane.  Use the Search box to filter the species in your model based on a match to either the species name or the structure name.  Delete species by highlighting and using the "Delete Selected" button below the table.  The <link target = "PathLink"> Pathway Link button is avaible to retrieve information from pathway databases.</link>  Use the <link target = "PP_Species"> Species Properties pane </link> to include annotation.
