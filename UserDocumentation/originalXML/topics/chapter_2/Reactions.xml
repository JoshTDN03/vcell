	<introduction>
Reactions define the stoichiometry and kinetics of the biological model. They consist of <def target = "def_species"> species 
		</def> (variables) and kinetic laws for reactions or membrane fluxes. Reactions involve species within a particular compartment volume or between a volume species and a species within an associated membrane.  
		Fluxes occur within membrane structures and involve volume species of the neighboring volumes. They can be created viewed and edited in <link target =  "ReactTabView"> tabular </link> or <link target = "ReactDiagView"> diagrammatic </link> views.  
		Properties for reactions can be found in the properties pane in the bottom of the window.
