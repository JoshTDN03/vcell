  <introduction>
  The membrane flux panel is used to display and edit properties of a membrane flux, which are the name, whether or not
  it is a molecular flux, an electric flux or both, the reaction rate J, 
  the electric current I, and the math expressions involved in J or I,
  and a free text annotation.
  </introduction>
		
  <appearance>
  <para>
  <imgReference target = "PP_MemFlux.png"/>
  On top, there is an editable field for the name of the reaction (i.e. the flux). The line below shows flux type checkboxes
  to select whether there is a molecular flux, whether there is an electric current, and a charge valence combobox showing
  the electric charge per molecule. 
  One line below that, there is a non-editable combobox
  offering a few options for laws governing the reaction rate or the electrical current or both, 
  and a conversion button to convert the rate law either from flux and current ("molecules per second") to 
  flux density and current density ("micromolar per second") or vice versa.
  </para>
  <para>
  Below these, taking most of the space of the panel, there is the kinetic table of math terms used to define the reaction rate J
  and the electric current density I: 
  the first two rows contain J and I, and further rows contain named mathematical terms referred to by J and I (e.g. kinetic parameters)
  or referred to by any of the other math terms 
  in the table. Note that among J and I, one of them is either zero or refers to the other. 
  If needed, the terms include species concentrations, whose name is the species name. 
  Typically, concentrations of all reactants and catalysts are needed (and products, if reversible).
  </para>
  <para>
  Columns of the kinetic table are: the name, the description, a checkbox whether it is a global expression 
  (i.e. shared across the model,
  as opposed to local, i.e. used only in this reaction), the math expression and the units of measurement.
  </para>
  <para>
  At the bottom, there is a text field for free text annotations, which can be hidden or shown by clicking on on the tiny button 
  left of the "Add Annotation Here" label.

    <para>
    The name of the reaction (i.e. the flux) can be changed by editing the text field. 
    A name already given to another reaction will be rejected.
    </para>
    <para>
    The flux type check boxes can be checked or unchecked to determine whether there is a flux of molecules, an electric current, 
    or both. The charge valence combobox allows selecting a charge per molecule in elementary charges, 
    an integer from minus five to five.
    </para>
    <para>
    The rate law combobox can be used to either select one of a few predefined laws for reaction rate or current
    or choose to enter a user-defined rate law, which describes a flux, flux density, current or current density. 
    Flux density and current density correspond to what would be micromolar per second in the case of reactions,
    while fluxes and currents correspond to molecules per second in the case of reactions, although the actual units are different. 
    </para>
    <para>
    In the case of flux density or current density, the conversion button will say "Convert to molecules per second", which means
    convert it to flux or current. In the case of flux or current, the conversion button will say "Convert to micromolar per second",
    which means convert it to a flux density or a current density.
    Note that predefined laws are flux densities or current densities, so if they are converted to fluxes or currents, they
    will be converted to user-defined, and remain so even if converted back.
    </para>
    <para>
    Expressions and their units can be edited except for predefined rate laws, species concentrations and universal constants. 
    Incompatible units will be silently rejected. 
    If references to new terms are added to expressions of existing ones, new rows will automatically be added for these terms. 
    Each term can be set to global or local by a checkbox, except for the reaction rate, which is always local, and species
    concentrations and universal constants, which are always global. 
    If a term is global, it is identical to any global term of the same name. If a term is
    local, it is different from any term in a different context.
