  <introduction>
  The reaction properties panel is used to display and edit properties of a reaction, which are the name, the kinetic law 
  (i.e. the reaction rate J and the math expressions involved in J),
  and a free text annotation.

  <para>
  On top, there is an editable field for the name of the reaction. One line below that, there is a non-editable combobox
  offering a few options for a reaction rate law, and a button to convert the rate law either from particle number to concentration
  or vice versa.
  </para>
  <para>
  Below these, taking most of the space of the panel, there is a kinetic table of mathematical expressions: the first row contains
  the reaction rate J, and further rows contain mathematical expressions referred to by J or any of the other math expressions 
  in the table. Typically, these expressions include species concentrations of reactants and catalysts (and products, if reversible).
  </para>
  <para>
  Columns of the kinetic table are: the name, the description, a check whether it is a global expression (as opposed to local to this
  reaction), the math expression and the units of measurement.
  </para>
  <para>
  At the bottom, there is a text field for free text annotations.
