<page title="Pathway Objects View">
	
	<introduction> 	
A table of pathway objects can be used to examine their properties and their link status. It is the 
table format representation of the 
		<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> Pathway Diagram View
		</link>
.
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>  
The table view shows the pathway objects, their type and also shows which of these object 
(if any) are linked to corresponding objects within the physiology.

<para></para>
It can be noticed that the selected reaction and its dependents are already 
linked to their respective physiology equivalents.
<para></para>
At the bottom of this view there are the Group, Delete and Physiology Link buttons 
with the same functionality as in the
		<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> Pathway Diagram View
		</link>
.
<para></para>

The bottom pane of the window displays a 
		<link target = "PP_Pathways"> Pathway Object Properties Pane 
		</link>
. In the sample image presented below you can see the properties of the biochemical 
reaction selected in the Pathway Object View above.
