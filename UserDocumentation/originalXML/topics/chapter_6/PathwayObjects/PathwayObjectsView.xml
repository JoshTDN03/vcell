	<introduction> 	
A table of pathway entities can be used to examine their properties and their link status. 
It is the table format representation of the 
		<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> Pathway Diagram View</link>
.
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>  
The table view shows the pathway entities, their type and also shows which of these 
entities (if any) are linked to corresponding entities within the physiology.

<para></para>
It can be noticed that the selected reaction and its dependents are already 
linked to their respective physiology equivalents.
<para></para>
At the bottom of this view there are the Group, Delete and Physiology Link buttons 
with the same functionality as in the
		<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> Pathway Diagram View
		</link>
.
<para></para>

The bottom pane of the window displays a 
		<link target = "PP_Pathways"> Pathway Object Properties Pane 
		</link>
. In the sample image presented below you can see the properties of the biochemical 
reaction selected in the Pathway Object View above.

The user can perform various operations upon these entities, either on individually selected 
entities or multiple selected entities using the
