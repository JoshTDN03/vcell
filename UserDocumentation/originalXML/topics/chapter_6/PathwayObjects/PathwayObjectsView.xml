	<introduction> 	
A table of pathway entities can be used to examine their properties and their link status. 
It is the table format representation of the 
		<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> Pathway Diagram View</link>
.
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>  
The table view shows the pathway entities, their type and also shows which of these 
entities (if any) are linked to corresponding entities within the physiology.
<para>

</para>
<para>
It can be noticed that the selected reaction and its dependents are already 
linked to their respective physiology equivalents.
</para>
<para>
At the bottom of this view there are the Group, Delete and Physiology Link buttons 
with the same functionality as in the
		<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> Pathway Diagram View
		</link>
.
</para>
<para>
The bottom pane of the window displays a 
		<link target = "PP_Pathways"> Pathway Object Properties Pane 
		</link>
. In the sample image presented below you can see the properties of the biochemical 
reaction selected in the Pathway Object View above.

	<operations>  
<para>
More entities can be added from the 
		<link target = "PathwayImportTable"> Pathway Import Table</link>
.
</para>
<para>
The user can perform various operations upon these entities, either on individually selected 
entities or multiple selected entities using the 
		<link target = "GroupOperationsPanel"> Operations Toolbar</link>
. Of particular interest is the process of importing pathway entities into the BioModel. 
Following this process, equivalent entities to those pathway entities being imported will 
be created within the Physiology.
