	<introduction>
<para>
Displays in a graphical form the entities selected by the user in the Pathway Panel. It 
can be used to examine their properties, import them within the model and manage their 
link status with model entities.
</para>
<para>
It is the graph format representation of the

</para>
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>
The view represents various entity types as circles and the relationships between them as 
full or dotted lines. The screenshot below shows two biochemical reactions and their 
dependent entities.

<para>
The bottom pane of the window displays a 
		<link target = "PP_Pathways"> Entity Properties Pane </link> 
where the properties of a selected entity are being displayed.

	<operations>
<para>
More entities can be added from the 
		<link target = "PathwayImportTable"> Imported Pathway View</link>.
</para>
<para>
The user can perform various operations upon these entities, either on individually selected 
entities or multiple selected entities using the 
		<link target = "GroupOperationsPanel"> Entities Management Toolbar</link>
. Of particular interest is the process of importing pathway entities into the BioModel. 
Following this process, equivalent entities to those pathway entities being imported will 
be created within the Physiology.

As an added capability, the items in the diagram can be filtered in real time by typing a string 
inside the Search field. All the matching entities will show up in the diagram as selected 
(marked in red).
