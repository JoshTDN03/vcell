	<introduction>
Cascading biochemical reactions occurring within a cell and carried out in a 
specific sequence are called a biochemical pathway. Numerous distinct pathways 
co-exist within a cell and they are quite elaborate because of the many 
participants involved.
<para></para>
We are providing a way of bringing the wealth of information contained in major 
pathway databases into your model - as a way of speed up the process of building 
a biomodel and, more important, as a way of annotating vCell entities.
<para>
The process begins with a 
<link target = "PathwayCommonsPanel"> keyword search </link> 
in the Pathway Commons Database - which will result in a list of pathways. 
</para>
<para>
The chosen pathway can be  
<link target = "PathwayImportTable"> imported in a table </link> which will display 
physical entities and interactions (entities).
</para>
<para>
Furthermore the user can choose the entities of interest and add them to a 
collection whose content can be displayed as a 
<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> diagram </link> 
or in a 
<link target = "PathwayObjectsView"> tabular format </link> 
. Detailed 
information about each entity is at this point available.
</para>
<para>
As a last step, the user can choose which entities will be made part of the biomodel 
through a 
<link target = "GroupOperationsPanel">  linking process </link>.
</para>
