	<introduction>
Cascading biochemical reactions occurring within a cell and carried out in a 
specific sequence are called a biochemical pathway. Numerous distinct pathways 
co-exist within a cell and they are quite elaborate because of the many 
participants involved.
<para></para>
We are providing a way of bringing the wealth of information contained in major 
pathway databases into your model - as a way to speed up the process of building 
a biomodel and, more important, as a way of annotating vCell entities.
<para>
The process begins with a 
<link target = "PathwayCommonsPanel"> keyword search</link> 
in the Pathway Commons Database - which will result in a list of pathways. 
</para>
<para>
The chosen pathway can be  
<link target = "PathwayImportTable"> imported in a table</link> which will display 
the entities (interactions and physical entities) it consists of.
</para>
<para>
Furthermore the user can choose the entities of interest and add them to a 
collection whose content can be displayed as a 
<link target = "PathwayDiagramView"> diagram</link> 
or in a 
<link target = "PathwayObjectsView"> tabular format</link>. Detailed 
information about each entity is at this point available.
</para>
<para>
As a last step, the user can choose which entities will be made part of the biomodel 
through a 
<link target = "GroupOperationsPanel">  linking process</link>. 
</para>
<para></para>
<para>
While working on other topics, click at any time on the Pathway tree item or on its 
children in the 
<link target = "GeneralNavAndWinSetup"> Navigation Panel</link>  
to return to displaying pathway entities.
