The National Resource for Cell Analysis and 
Modeling has developed the Virtual Cell Modeling and
Simulation Framework version 5.0. This 
unique software platform has been designed to model cell
biological processes. This new technology associates 
biochemical and electrophysiological data describing
individual reactions with experimental microscopic 
image data describing their subcellular locations.
Cell physiological events can then be simulated 
within the empirically derived geometries,
thus facilitating the direct comparison of model 
predictions with experiment.

The Virtual Cell consists of a biological and 
mathematical framework. Scientists can create biological
models from which the software will generate the 
mathematical code needed to run simulations.
Mathematicians may opt to use the math framework, 
based on the Virtual Cell Math Language, for
creating their own mathematical descriptions.

Models can be reused, updated and published so
they are available to the scientific community. In
addition, models may also be privately shared
amongst collaborating groups. The data from
simulations is stored on the Virtual Cell database
server and is easily exported in a variety of formats.
Access to the Virtual Cell modeling software is
available via the internet using a JAVA based interface.
Version 5.0. of the Virtual Cell has been
developed using the latest supported Java technology.
