The Virtual Cell Modeling and Simulation Framework (VCell) version 5.1
was developed by the National Resource for Cell Analysis and 
Modeling. This unique software platform has been designed to model cell
biological processes. Biochemical and electrophysiological data describing
individual reactions are associated with experimental microscopic 
image data describing their subcellular locations. Cell physiological events 
can then be simulated within the empirically derived geometries, thus facilitating 
the direct comparison of model predictions with experiment.

VCell consists of a biological and mathematical framework. Scientists can create 
biological models from which the software will generate the mathematical code 
needed to run simulations.  Mathematicians may opt to use the math framework, 
based on the Virtual Cell Math Language, for creating their own mathematical descriptions.

Models can be reused, updated and published so they are available to the scientific community. In
addition, models may also be privately shared amongst collaborating groups. The data from
simulations are stored on the Virtual Cell database server and are easily exported in a variety of formats.
Access to the Virtual Cell modeling software is available via the internet using a JAVA based interface.
Version 5.1. of the Virtual Cell has been developed using the latest supported Java technology.
