	Clicking on <bold>File->Open</bold> menu option shows another menu popup where the user can choose to open  a <bold>BioModel</bold>, <bold>MathModel</bold> or <bold>Geometry</bold> document. 
	Clicking on any of those options opens a dialog that lists models of that particular document type in the VCell database that are available to the user (those created by the user and those shared with the user by other users). 
	For example, clicking on 'File->Open->BioModel' will open a dialog that lists all BioModels accessible to current user.
