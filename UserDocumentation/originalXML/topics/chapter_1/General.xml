The Virtual Cell Software requires BioModels and
Geometries to generate the mathematical code
needed for running simulations. The BioModel consists
of the model description (Physiology), and the
Application. 
<para></para>
The <link target = "PhysOverview"> Physiology</link> 
includes what is known
about the biological system in terms of cellular structures, 
species and biochemical reactions. 
<para></para>
The <link target = "ApplicationOverview"> Application</link> 
allows the user to define the 
quantitative conditions needed to define, run and visualize a Virtual
Experiment, i.e. numerical simulation. Thus, an
Application includes the Structure Mapping, Initial
Conditions, Reaction Mapping, Electrical Mapping and
Simulations. 
<para></para>
The Application establishes the relationship between the biological 
model and the <link target = "GeometryOverview"> Geometry</link>.
<para></para>
A single BioModel may have numerous 
Applications related to it, in which
geometries and/or parameters have been changed.
