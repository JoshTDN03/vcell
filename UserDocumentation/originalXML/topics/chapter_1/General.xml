The Virtual Cell Software requires BioModels and
Geometries to generate the mathematical code
needed for running simulations. A BioModel consists
of a model description (Physiology), and one or more Applications. 
<para></para>
The <link target = "PhysOverview"> Physiology</link> 
includes what is known
about the biological system in terms of cellular structures, 
species and biochemical reactions. 
<para></para>
Each <link target = "ApplicationOverview"> Application</link> 
allows the user to define the 
quantitative conditions needed to define, run and visualize a Virtual
Experiment, i.e. numerical simulation. Thus, an
Application includes the Geometry, the Specifications (species, 
reactions), Protocols (events, electrical mapping), Simulations and 
Parameter Estimation (if applicable).
<para></para>
The Application establishes the relationship between the biological 
model and the <link target = "GeometryOverview"> Geometry</link>.
<para></para>
A single BioModel may have numerous 
Applications, in which geometries and/or parameters have been changed.  Each
Application, in turn can have multiple Simulations, in which different numerical
methods or conditions are used.
