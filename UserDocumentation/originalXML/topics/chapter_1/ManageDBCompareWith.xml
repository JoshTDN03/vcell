	<introduction>
	<para>It is difficult to compare models by simply visually inspecting the different components. 
	Instead, the best way to compare models is with the Compare Models feature which automatically performs a side-by-side comparison of all the different components of the model.

	<para>
	To compare models, the user can open the tool via the "Database Manager" from one of the documents, <bold>File->Manage Database->Compare With->Latest Edition/Previous Edition/Other</bold>.
	A baseline model selection in the Database Manager has to be made before choosing an option in the <bold>Compare With</bold> menu. 
	Alternately, in the Database Manager, the user can select the baseline model and click the right mouse button and choose <bold>Compare With->Previous Edition/Latest Edition/Another Edition/Another Model</bold>. 
	In the dialog that appears, the user can select the model he/she wishes to compare against the selected baseline model and press the <bold>Open</bold> button.
	</para>

	<para>
	The models are compared and the user is presented with a composite model in a <bold>Compare Models</bold> dialog, shown above, where only differences are indicated. A <bold>X</bold> will indicate which part of the model is different. 
	The <bold>X</bold> will originate at the parent level in the tree and travel down the tree wherever there is a difference between the two models. 
	At the level where that item is, it will be marked with an <bold>?</bold>. Items that are only in the modified model are marked with an <bold>N</bold> for <bold>new</bold>. 
	Items that are only in the baseline model are marked with an <bold>R</bold> for <bold>removed</bold>; they are considered to be removed from the modified model.
	</para>
	<para>
	When any of these items are selected, the value in the baseline model and the modified model are displayed in the text area below. 
	If the user is aware that any two similar items (for example., 2 species in the models being compared) represent the same entity, the two items can be selected and the <bold>Associate</bold> button can be clicked to associate the two items.
	Similarly, <bold>Disassociate</bold> button will disassociate two similar items in the two models being compared. This will not alter the original models in any way.
