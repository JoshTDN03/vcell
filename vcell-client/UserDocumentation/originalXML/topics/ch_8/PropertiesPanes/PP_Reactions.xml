  <introduction>
  The reaction Properties pane is used to display and edit properties of a reaction.

  <para>
  The top of the table shows the Reaction Name,a combobox for Kinetic Type, and a button to convert the rate law either from molecules per 
  second to micromolar per second or vice versa. Below is a table of the kinetic terms used to define the reaction rate 
  (J) that includes all mathematical terms referred to in the mathematical expression for J or other kinetic terms.  A link or text bubble icon next to the name indicates that either a link or text annotation is associated with the reaction.  Clicking on the icon will navigate to the Annotations Pane.  Items in brown cannot be edited.

    <para>
    <bold>Edit the reaction name</bold> using the text field. A name already given to another reaction will be rejected.
   </para>
   <para><bold>Make reaction reversible</bold> using the check box underneath the reaction name. The check box is only visible when the appropriate kinetic type is selected.
   </para>
    <para>
    <bold>Select a rate law</bold> using the combobox to select one of a few predefined rate laws 
    (mass action, Michaelis-Menten reversible and irreversible) in micromolar per second or to enter a user-defined 
    rate law, either in micromolar per second or in molecules per second. 
    </para>
    <para>
    <bold>Convert the rate law</bold> from micromolar per second to molecules per second, or vice versa, using the 
    <bold>Convert to</bold> button. Note that predefined laws are only in micromolar per second, so if they are converted 
    to molecules per second, the user-defined kinetic law will automatically be selected, and remain so even if converted back.
    </para>
    <para>
    <bold> Edit Expressions and their units</bold> in the Expression column. An autofill menu will dropdown as you type to easily find already defined parameters and species that can be included in the expression. Species entered in the rate expression will automatically be assigned as catalysts.  
    <list>
    <item>Predefined rate laws, species concentrations and universal constants cannot be edited.</item> 
    <item>Incompatible units will be silently rejected.</item> 
    <item>If references to new terms are added, new rows will automatically be added for these terms.  An expression for each new
    term must be added in the expression column</item> 
    <item>Terms can be set to <def target = "def_Global">global</def> or <def target = "def_Local">local</def> using a 
    checkbox, except for the reaction rate, which is always local.  Species concentrations and universal constants 
    are always global.</item>
