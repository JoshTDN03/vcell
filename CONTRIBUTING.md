# Guide to contributing to the Virtual Cell

We believe - and we hope you do too - that learning how to code, how to think, and how to contribute to open source can delegate the next generation of coders and creators. We exuberantly welcome contributions to Virtual Cell! This document describes how developers can contribute to the Virtual Cell. Modelers can contribute new models to VCell via multi-platform standalone application downloading from http://vcell.org.

If you have never contributed to an open-source project before and youâ€™re just getting started, consider exploring these resources.
