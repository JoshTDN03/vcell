<p><h2>Reactions Properties Pane</h2></p>
<p>
  The reaction properties panel is used to display and edit properties of a reaction

  The top of the table shows the Reaction Name,a combobox for Kinetic Type, and a button to convert the rate law either from molecules per 
  second to micromolar per second or vice versa. Below is a table of the kinetic terms used to define the reaction rate 
  (J)that includes all mathematical terms referred to in the mathematical expression for J or other kinetic terms.  Concentrations 
  of all species referred to in the kinetic terms (e.g.reactants, catalysts, products)are required. Items in brown cannot be edited.
  </p>
</p>
<p><p><b>Edit the reaction name</b> using the text field. A name already given to another reaction will be rejected.
    </p>
<p><b>Select a rate law</b> using the combobox to select one of a few predefined rate laws 
    (mass action, Michaelis-Menten reversible and irreversible) in micromolar per second or to enter a user-defined 
    rate law, either in micromolar per second or in molecules per second. 
    </p>
<p><b>Convert the rate law</b> from micromolar per second to molecules per second, or vice versa, using the 
    <b>Convert to</b> button. Note that predefined laws are only in micromolar per second, so if they are converted 
    to molecules per second, the user-defined kinetic law will automatically be selected, and remain so even if converted back.
    </p>
<p><b> Edit Expressions and their units</b> in the Expression column.  
    <ul><li>Predefined rate laws, species concentrations and universal constants cannot be edited.</li>
<li>Incompatible units will be silently rejected.</li>
<li>If references to new terms are added, new rows will automatically be added for these terms.  An expression for each new
    term must be added in the expression column</li>
<li>Terms can be set to <a href="../../Ch_9/Appendix/Definitions.html#def_Global">
<i>global</i></a> or <a href="../../Ch_9/Appendix/Definitions.html#def_Local">
<i>local</i></a> using a 
    checkbox, except for the reaction rate, which is always local.  Species concentrations and universal constants 
    are always global.</li>
</ul>
<b> Add Annotations</b> in the Annotation text field, which can be shown or hiddenby selecting the plus or minus 
    sign next to the <b>Add Annotation Here</b>.text.  Annotations apply to the entire reaction.
