<p><h2>Observables Properties Pane</h2></p>
<p>
	The observables properties tree on a left allows editing of the Observable name, 
	adding/editing/deleting sites and site states. Right pane is uneditable and provides real-time updates 
	of the observable composition.

<ul><li>Each Observable consists of one or more <b>Species Patters</b> that 
	define common features of species selected by Observable.</li>
<li>Each SpeciesPattern consists of one or more of Molecules (connected through explicit bonds). </li>
<li>Sites that have specified state are shown in green with state shown
	underneath the site shape.</li>
<li>Sites may have defined binding - they can be explicitly bound to another site, 
	declared unbound or declared bound to unspecified site - then the site is shown in green with bond (if exists) 
	shown in solid color.</li>
<li>Site than can be in any state and can be bound or unbound is shown in white, with possible bond shown 
	in grey as a question mark.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><ul><li>Observable name: Right click to add Species Pattern (species with a given set of features).</li>
<li>Species Pattern: Right click to delete Pattern or Add Molecules that constitute pattern.</li>
<li>Molecule is added with all sites being in unspecified state (white). Right click on a 
	site to choose a state and specify bond - a site can be connected to any other site in a species pattern, 
	or be declared bound or unbound.</li>
