<p><h2>Overview</h2></p>
<p> 
The Virtual Cell Software provides 2 environments for defining computational models.  
<b>BioModels</b> and <b>MathModels</b> allow the user to create models using the tool that best suits their experience.  
A BioModel consists of a model description (Physiology), and one or more Applications generated using a graphical interface to define model elements.  
A MathModel is a document defined using the VCell Markup Language (VCML) and is created using VCML 'code'.
<p><b>BioModel</b></p>

The <a href="../../ch_2/Physiology/PhysOverview.html">BioModel Physiology</a> 
includes what is known about the biological system in terms of cellular structures, species and biochemical reactions. 

Each <a href="../../ch_3/BioModelApplications/ApplicationOverview.html">BioModel Application</a> 
allows the user to define the  quantitative conditions needed to define, run and visualize a Virtual Experiment, i.e. numerical simulation.  
Thus, an Application includes the Geometry, the Specifications (species, 
reactions), Protocols (events, electrical mapping), Simulations and Parameter Estimation (if applicable).

A single BioModel may have numerous 
Applications, in which geometries and/or parameters have been changed.  Each
Application, in turn can have multiple Simulations, in which different numerical
methods or conditions are used.

<p><b>MathModel</b></p>

MathModels define Virtual Experiments using VCell Markup Language.

Both BioModels and MathModels have the same interface for defining spatial domains as <a href="../../ch_3/BioModelApplications/Geometry/GeometryOverview.html">geometries</a>.
