<p><h2>Reactions Diagram View</h2></p>
<p> 
	The reaction diagram shows a bipartite graph of species (green balls) and reactions (yellow squares), each within the appropriate
	compartments, and connected by lines showing which species participates in which reaction.
	</p>
<p><br><br>
<img align=left src="../image/ReactDiagView.png" width="569" height="453">
<p> 
	Compartments are depicted as connected rectangles, with membrane compartments separating adjacent volume compartments. 
	Species are green balls and reactions are yellow squares placed into the compartments. Lines each connect one 
	species with one reaction: solid lines with arrows denote reactants and products; dashed lines denote catalysts. 
	Stoichiometric coefficients, if different from one, are displayed next to the appropriate lines.
	</p>
<p>
	A toolbar above the graph provides buttons for editing, adjusting zoom, and changing the layout of the elements.
	</p>
<p>
	A toolbar at the bottom of graph provides a means to search a text field, delete items, or search for pathways using the <a href="../chapter_6/PathwayOverview.html"> Pathway Links </a>.
	</p>
</p>

	The tool bar above the graph provides tools for creating and editing species, reactions, and fluxes; selecting the tool alters the
	function of the mouse as described below.
	  <ul><li>
	    The arrow enables <b>selection mode</b>. Species (graph nodes) and connecting lines (edges) can be selected 
	    by mouse click, or drag the mouse to select multiple components. Add elements to the selection using the shift key
	    with the left mouse button, toggle the selection using the control key.
	    </li>
<li>
	    The green ball <b> enables adding new species </b> by clicking within a compartment. Preliminary names for species are generated
	    automatically, but can be changed immediately in the <a href="../PropertiesPanes/PP_Species.html"> species property panel </a>.
	    </li>
<li>
	    The solid line with arrow enables one to <b>create reactants/products</b> of a reaction or membrane flux.  
	    Drag the mouse drag to assign reactant or product roles by connecting species or reactions. The direction of 
	    the drag determines whether a reactant or product role is assigned (e.g. dragging from species to reaction 
	    creates a reactant role, dragging from reaction to species creates a product role). No relationship is created 
	    if VCell constraints would be violated, e.g. two reactants cannot be in different volume compartments. 
	    <b> Create a reaction</b> by dragging from species to species (or open space) <b>Create an intermediary 
	    species </b> by dragging from reaction to reaction (or open space). <b>Create a membrane flux</b> by 
	    dragging from a species across a membrane to empty space from empty space to empty space (a species will be 
	    created in both volume compartments), or between the equivalent species in separate volume compartments.
	    </li>
<li>
	    The dotted line <b>creates a catalyst</b>, by dragging from a species to a reaction or vice versa. Connecting a species with
	    empty space creates a new reaction and connecting a reaction to empty space creates a new species.
	    </li>
<li>
	    The <b>zoom in</b> and <b>zoom out</b> buttons vary the magnification of the diagram.
	    </li>
<li>
	    The <b>layout buttons</b> automatically arrange the components (graph elements) by different algorithms. 
	    These include (from left to right) random, within an ellipse within each compartment, so that most lines point downward, to make lines
	    shorter and more similar to each other in lengths, and to place nodes more evenly across each compartment.
	    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The <b>search text field</b> allows the user to select multiple components that have a similar name.
	</p>
<p>
	The <b>delete button</b> deletes selected elements. Delete will fail if a species is connected to a reaction or flux; you must first
	delete the reaction or disconnect the species from the reaction.
	</p>
<p>
	The <a href="../chapter_6/PathwayOverview.html"> pathway links button</a> allows the user to follow links from model elements (species, reactions or fluxes) to pathway elements, or to 
	edit pathway links.
    </p>
