A table of reactions and fluxes can be used to create and edit reactions. 
	</p>
<p>
The table view shows the reaction, a user defined name for the reaction, the structure where the reaction occurs and the type of kinetic law governing the reacction.  The bottom pane of the window displays a 

		

, or 

		

, depending on the current selection. 
	</p>
<p>
Enter a new reaction by double clicking "add new" in the table.  In the popup box select the structure where the reaction occurs, define a name for the reaction and type the reaction using the format "a+b->c" where a and b, etc. are reactants and c, etc are products. Numbers before a species name are used to indicate stoichiometry.   If a, b, etc have not been defined, they are automatically created as species within the structure where the reaction occurs.

Edit the kinetic type, rate constants, and catalysts by selecting the reaction for membrane flux in the table and editing the
