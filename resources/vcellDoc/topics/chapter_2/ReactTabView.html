<p><h2>Reactions Table View</h2></p>
<p>
	A table of reactions and membrane fluxes can be used to create and edit reactions. 
	</p>
<p>
	The table shows the reaction, a user defined name for the reaction, the structure where the reaction occurs
	 and the type of kinetic law governing the reaction.  The bottom pane of the window displays a <a href="../PropertiesPanes/PP_Reactions.html"> Reaction Properties Pane</a>,
	or <a href="../PropertiesPanes/PP_MemFlux.html"> Membrane Flux property pane</a>, depending on the current selection. 
	</p>
<p><b>Enter</b> a new reaction by double clicking "add new" in the table.  In the popup box select the structure
	where the reaction occurs, define a name for the reaction and type the reaction using the format "a+b->c" 
	where a and b, etc. are reactants and c, etc are products. Numbers before a species name are used to indicate 
	stoichiometry.   If a, b, etc have not been defined, they are automatically created as species within the 
	structure where the reaction occurs.

<p><b>Edit</b> kinetic type, rate constants, and catalysts by selecting the reaction or membrane flux 
	in the table and editing the <a href="../PropertiesPanes/PP_Reactions.html"> Reaction Properties pane</a> or 
	<a href="../PropertiesPanes/PP_MemFlux.html"> Flux Properties pane</a> as appropriate.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> a reaction by selecting a row or rows and using the "Delete Selected" button
	 at the bottom of the table.</p>
<p> Use the <a href="PathLink.html"> Pathway Links</a> to find reactions within 
	<a href="../Appendix/Definitions.html#def_pathcom">
