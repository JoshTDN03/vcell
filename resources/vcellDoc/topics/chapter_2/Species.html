<p>Species</p>
<p>
In BioModels species are used to create variables (molecular species) in <a href="..\chapter_2\Reactions.html"> reactions and fluxes</a>. They can exist in both  and  (volumes) of the cellular structures. Species are unique pools of molecules within a single compartment. If the same molecular component is present in multiple compartments, the compartment name is appended to the species name to retain a unique identifier, e.g. species_compartment.

<p>
The Species Tab diplays a table of the species name and the  that contains it.  The <a href="..\PropertiesPanes\PP_Species.html"> Species Properties pane </a> is shown in the bottom right pane
	</p>
<p>
The species name can be edited by highlighting and typing in either the tabular view or within the properties pane.  Use the Search box to filter the species in your model based on a match to either the species name or the structure name.  Delete species by highlighting and using the "Delete Selected" button below the table.  The   Use the <a href="..\PropertiesPanes\PP_Species.html"> Species Properties pane </a> to include annotation.
