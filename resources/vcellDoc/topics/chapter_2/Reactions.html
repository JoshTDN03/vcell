<p>Reactions</p>
<p>
Reactions define the stoichiometry and kinetics of the biological model. They consist of  (variables) and kinetic laws for reactions or membrane fluxes. Reactions involve species within a particular compartment volume or between a volume species and a species within an associated membrane.  Fluxes occur within membrane structures and involve volume species of the neighboring volumes. They can be created viewed and edited in  or  views.  Properties for reactions can be found in the properties pane in the bottom of the window.
