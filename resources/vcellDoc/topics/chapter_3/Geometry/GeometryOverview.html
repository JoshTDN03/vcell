<p><h2>Geometry Overview</h2></p>
<p>
There are 2 types of geometries in VCell, <b>spatial</b> and <b>non-spatial</b>: 
<ul><li>Non-spatial geometries (0 dimensional and not spatially resolved) are implicitly defined in non-spatial applications (for ODE and non-spatial stochastic simulations).</li>
<li>Spatial geometries (1,2,3 dimensional and spatially resolved) must be explicitly defined by the user in spatial applications (for PDE and spatial stochastic simulations).</li>
</ul>

Spatial geometries can be defined in several ways:
<ul><li>Re-using previously defined geometries from other VCell model applications (including shared models from other users).</li>
<li>Creating new geometries by defining analytic equations that describe compartment distributions in space.  (<a href="geom_Analytic.html">Analytic Geometry</a>)</li>
<li>Creating new geometries by manually defining compartments on a regular grid of points in space (image painting).  (<a href="geom_from_images.html">Image Geometry</a>)</li>
<li>Creating new geometries by importing pre-segmented image files defining compartments as areas of different pixel values.  (<a href="geom_from_images.html">Image Geometry</a>)</li>
<li>Creating new geometries by importing image files as templates and performing image processing functions to define compartments.  (<a href="geom_from_images.html">Image Geometry</a>)</li>
<li>Creating new geometries by importing surface mesh files and sampling within a spatial domain to define compartments.  (<a href="geom_from_surface.html">Geometry from Surface</a>)</li>
</ul>

Geometries can be viewed as:
<ul><li>Individual image planes in the x,y,z dimension.</li>
<li>Rendered surface boundaries between compartment regions.</li>
</ul>

The Geometry domain (origin and extent) can be edited. The geometry can be exported in different surface mesh formats by clicking the <b>Export...</b> button.  
Analytic geometries functions can be edited in place by double-clicking the table cell containing the analytic expression.
An analytic geometry can be converted to an <a href="geom_from_images.html">Image Geometry</a> by clicking the <b>Edit Image</b> button.
The currently defined geometry can be changed (replaced).
