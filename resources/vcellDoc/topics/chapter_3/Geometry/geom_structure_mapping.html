<p><h2>Structure Mapping</h2></p>
<p>
	Structure Mapping defines the relationship between the physiology (Compartments/Structures) and the geometry (Domains).
	The mapping provides information to simulation solvers that identifies a physiology structure at every point in space.

	MathModel structure mappings are implicit in the definition of a MathModel document (described elsewhere).
	Compartmental (non-spatial) BioModel structure mapping (to an empty geometry) is created automatically.  
	Spatial BioModel structure mappings are defined by the user within an "Application" after all physiology compartments and a spatial geometry have been added.
	Expand the "Applications" tab and select a previously defined application.  Click the "Structure Mapping" tab.
	There are 3 panels, on the left is the "physiology (structures)" panel, on the right is the "Geometry (subdomains)" panel and on the bottom is the "Structure Mapping" table.
	Choose 1 of the methods below to map each physiology structure to the appropriate geometry subdomain: 
	1.  For each distinct physiology structure, select the "mapping" tool and click on a point within the physiology structure (left panel) and drag to a colored square next to the appropriate geometry subdomain (right panel).  (ignore any 2-color squares).
	- or -
	2.  In the "Structure Mapping" table click the table under the "Subdomain" heading next to the "Structure" you want to map and choose a geometry domain from the pop-up list that appears to define the mapping.

	The BioModel "Structure Mapping" table also provides 2 additional parameter editing capabilities depending on the type of geometry defined.
	1.  For applications with NON-SPATIAL geometries the "Structure Mapping" table allows the user to enter "Size" information.
	"Size" information defines the volume (in units of um2) of a particular structure.  The size does not include the sizes of any other structures or membrane surface areas.
	2.  For applications with SPATIAL geometries the "Structure Mapping" table allows the user to enter boundary conditions.
	Boundary conditions are represented in the "Structure Mapping" table as 6 table columns.  Each column represents an edge of the simulation world.
	"-X" represents the edge of the simulation world in the minus X direction. the other columns have similar meaning for the indicated axis (XYZ) and direction (-+).
	Click on (-X,+X,-Y,+Y,-Z,+Z) to set one of 2 boundary conditions (FLUX, VALUE) for each structure/subdomain mapping.
	FLUX instructs the solver to use an explicitly defined constant or function to calculate the flux (uM.um.s-1) of a species at the simulation world boundary.
	VALUE instructs the solver to use an explicitly defined constant or function to calculate the concentration (uM) of a species at the simulation world boundary.
	The boundary condition chosen will determine how a species interacts with the simulation world boundary.
	The actual constant or function is defined for each species in the (see <a href="../Specifications/SpeciesSpecifications.html">Specifications->Species</a>) panel.
	One or more of the structures may be mapped to a spatial geometry domain that does not intersect the edge of the simulation world and this setting will have no effect.
