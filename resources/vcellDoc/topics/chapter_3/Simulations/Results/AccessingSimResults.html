<p><h2>Accessing Simulation Results</h2></p>
<p> Results from simulations are automatically stored on the remote database server. The Results button becomes active once results are available for a newly run simulation or when a previously run simulation is selected. The results may be reviewed immediately by pressing the Results button on the Simulation panel of the Application dialog. This activates the Simulation Results Viewer. The viewer for results differ for non-spatial and spatial models.

	A list of simulations, both run, failed, in progress and never run are visible and 
	labeled accordingly.  If a simulation with results is selected, the results button 
	(with a graph icon) becomes active (ungreyed).

	When the simulation results button is pressed when a simulation with results is 
	selected, a PDE Data Viewer window appears 
	</p>
<p>
	
	The Simulation Results Viewer has three tabs: View Data, Export Data, and Post Processing Data.
	 The following sections describe functions within the View Data tab.
The image data from spatial simulations are displayed in the results dialog. You can also generate a Spatial Plot, using defined regions, a Time Plot, using points, or a Kymograph, which displays a line scan over time.
