<p><h2>Compartment Simulation Results Viewer</h2></p>
<p>
	
Simulation displays results as a graph (Plot) or a table of the values (Values). Use the toggle buttons to switch between Plot and Values views. The default view is Plot of a single variable from the model on the Y axis against time on the X axis. Results from Stochastic multi-trial simulations are displayed as a histogram.

<p><p>X and Y Axes:
Select a variable for each axis; the graph will update accordingly. A different line color is displayed for each variable plotted on the y-axis. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to step through the list of variables; the graph will update with each variable change. You can select more than one variable by using the Shift key for sequential variables or by using the Ctrl key for random variables. Simulation displays results as a graph of the values. Mousing over the graph will give values at indi- vidual points. The default view is Plot of a single variable from the model on the Y axis against time on the X axis. Results from Stochastic multi-trial simulations are displayed as a histogram (see XXX for creating Stochastic multi-trial simulations).
</p>
<p>Time Series Plot:
The Time Series plot is specified by selecting the independent variable t, in the X axis choice box, and a dependent variable in the Y axis choice box.
</p>
<p>Phase Plane Plots: 
Phase Plane plots are generated and displayed by selecting two dependent variables, one for the X axis and another for the Y axis.
</p>
<p>Toggle Plot/Data views: 
You can toggle between plot and data values by pressing the Values icon. From the Data ta- ble view, you can copy the values and paste directly into a tab delimited spreadsheet. Use ctrl C to copy individual cells and ctrl K to copy all the data values. Right-click a cell to bring up the copy menu: Copy for the individual cell, Copy All for all data values.
</p>
<p>
Plot Settings: 
The graph is interactive. Move your cursor over the graph, a crosshair will appear and the corresponding X and Y coordinate values will be displayed in the bottom left corner of the dialog. Right click your mouse in the plot area to access Plot Settings.
</p>
<p>
Axis Scale: 
Select either auto scale mode or deselect for manual scale model.
When in manual mode you must supply min and max graph values.
</p>
<p>
Auto Scale: 
Computer will calculate best values for displaying graph.
???</p>
<p>
Stretch: In auto mode, use to stretch graph for better viewing.
</p>
<p>
Plots: 
Plot display options.
</p>
<p>
Draw nodes: 
Select to draw a node at each data point.
</p>
<p>
Show crosshair: 
Enable the crosshair to be displayed when you move your mouse over the graph.
</p>
<p>
Snap to nodes: 
Select to have crosshair snap to nodes, deselect to move crosshair freely across the graph.
</p>
<p>
Histogram of Stochastic Simulations: 
For Stochastic Applications, when multiple trials of a stochastic simulation is run (See Chapter 7, regarding stochastic integrators), the results of the final run are displayed as a histogram instead of a plot. The X-axis of the histograms is auto-ranged to the possible values for the variable plotted on the Y-axis. The Y-axis is the calculated distribution of the variable over the range of possible values based on the results of the simulation trials. The calculated val-
ues for the distributions can be viewed by using the toggle button.

<p>
Log Sensitivity: 
Log Sensitivity is active when Sensitivity Analysis was chosen in
Simulation Tasks (LINK NEEDED). Sensitivity results that were calculated as the simulation
ran are available in two ways. 
</p>
<ul><p>
1) Choose a variable from the selection list to plot. Use the scroll bar below the Log Sensitivity
check box to alter the parameter value and update the graph.
Clicking Log Sensitivity displays the normalized (log) sensitivities as a function of time. 
</p>
<p>
2) The sensitivity of a species (variable) with respect to the selected pa- rameter is displayed 
in the variable column as ‘sens_variable_wrt_parameter’ and can be plotted in relation to time. 
The solutions for altered parameter values are approximate since the sensitivity analysis is 
based on the nominal value. Thus, the farther away from the nominal value the less accurate a solution is. However, the results may still be interpreted qualita-
tively. If the user requires an accurate solution based on the qualitative data, 
it is recommended to rerun the simulation with the appropriate parameter(s) changed.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
View Data for Parameter Values: 
When simulations have one or more parameter scans, a table of all
parameters which have been scanned is shown as a table at the
bottom of the window. The column headers have the name of the
parameters, and each column has rows listing actual values that
were used. To see the data for another combination of values, click
in the parameter value table and select different values for one or more of the parameters. The data for a single or multiple variables can be displayed simultaneously for multiple parameter scan results.
</p>
<p>
Values Display: 
The reference to x and y axes are retained in the table view of values. The variable selected in the y- axis drop down window is placed in the first column. A single or multiple variables can be chosen. For each variable selected, a column is added.
???
Single and multiple cells within the table may also be selected. Use ctrl C to copy individual cells and ctrl K to copy all the cells into a spreadsheet. Alternatively, hold down the right mouse button to ac- cess a menu with Copy and Copy All options.
