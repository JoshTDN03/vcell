<p><h2>Biological Pathways Overview</h2></p>
<p>
Cascading biochemical reactions occurring within a cell and carried out in a 
specific sequence are called a biochemical pathway. Numerous distinct pathways 
co-exist within a cell and they are quite elaborate because of the many 
participants involved.
<p></p>

We are providing a way of bringing the wealth of information contained in major 
pathway databases into your model - as a way to speed up the process of building 
a biomodel and, more important, as a way of annotating vCell entities.
<p>
The process begins with a 
<a href="../../ch_7/DatabaseSources/PathwayCommonsPanel.html"> keyword search</a> 
in the Pathway Commons Database - which will result in a list of pathways. 
</p>
<p>
The chosen pathway can be  
<a href="PathwayImportTable.html"> imported in a table</a> which will display 
the entities (interactions and physical entities) it consists of.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore the user can choose the entities of interest and add them to a 
collection whose content can be displayed as a 
<a href="PathwayDiagram/PathwayDiagramView.html"> diagram</a> 
or in a 
<a href="PathwayObjects/PathwayObjectsView.html"> tabular format</a>. Detailed 
information about each entity is at this point available.
</p>
<p>
As a last step, the user can choose which entities will be made part of the biomodel 
through a 
<a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/GroupOperationsPanel.html">  linking process</a>. 
</p>
<p>
While working on other topics, click at any time on the Pathway tree item or on its 
children in the 
<a href="../../ch_1/Introduction/GeneralNavAndWinSetup.html"> Navigation Panel</a>  
to return to displaying pathway entities.
