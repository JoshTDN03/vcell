<p><h2>VCell Database</h2></p>
<p><p>
	The Virtual Cell Database repository stores all the models created using the Virtual Cell software. 
	The current user has access to the models created by him/her, models that are shared with the current user by other VCell users and those that are public.

	The Virtual Cell Database can be accessed from 'Database' panel on the lower left corner of any VCell document window. The first tab in this panel is the <b>VCell Database</b> tab.
	Choosing this tab displays another set of 3 tabs - <b>BioModels</b>, <b>MathModels</b>, and <b>Geometry</b> that display the accessible models of that document type.
	The functionality of this panel is same as that of the <b>Database Manager</b> (refer to section <a href="../chapter_1/ManageDatabase.html">File -> ManageDatabase</a>).
	</p>
<p>
	Selecting a model of any document type in the VCell Database displays the database information for the model in the <b>Database File Info</b> tab in the 'Properties' panel on the lower right hand corner of any VCell document. 
	The figure below shows the 'Database File Info' for a BioModel selected in the VCell Database->BioModels tab.
