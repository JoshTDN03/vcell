<p><h2>Structure Mapping for non-spatial geometries</h2></p>
<p>
	Compartmental BioModel structure mapping (to an empty geometry) is created automatically. 
	However, it is necessary to define the size (micrometers cubed for volume structures -or- microns squared for membrane structures) of each compartment.

<p><p><b>Edit or Enter</b> structure volume within the Structure Mapping table in the bottom panel by editing the "Size" column.  
	For help determining appropriate values, select "Volume and Surface Calculator" to bring up a calculator to provide volume and surface area information for common geometries (e.g. sphere or cube) based on radius or side lengths. 
	Click "Volume and Surface Calculator" again to hide the calculator.  See <a href="geom_nonspatial_old_mapping.html">Non-Spatial Legacy Mapping</a> for older model non-spatial geometry mapping.

<p>
	If one creates a new non-spatial application by copying a spatial application as nonspatial, the equivalent compartment sizes will be pre-computed and automatically entered into the appropriate fields.
