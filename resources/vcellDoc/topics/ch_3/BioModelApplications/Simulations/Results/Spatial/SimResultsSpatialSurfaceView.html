<p><h2>Spatial Simulation Results Overview</h2></p>
<p>

Membrane Surfaces Viewer: The Membrane Surface Viewer is accessed via the Simulation Results Viewer when a Membrane vari- able is selected from the list of variable names. The "Show Membrane Surfaces" button is then active at the bottom of the Simulation Results Viewer. The Membrane Surface Viewer is initialized with the color scaling and data values for the current membrane variable name and time point chosen in the Simulation Results Viewer.
</p>
<p><p>
Synchronize Display Parameters: When the Membrane Surface Viewer has been activated the "Show Membrane Surfaces" button text on the Simulation Results Viewer will change to "Update Membrane Surfaces". This button may be pressed at any time to synchronize the display parameters of the Membrane Surface Viewer to the current display parameters of the Simulation Results Viewer. The parameters include variable, time and color scaling. When the Membrane Surface Viewer is closed (click on X in upper right corner) the window will disappear but the current view and pick info settings will not be lost.

Changing views
</p>
<ul><li>
ROTATE: 
The view may be rotated arbitrarily using a "trackball" interface by dragging the mouse with the left mouse button (leftMB) pressed. The view rotates as if the mouse were attached to a sphere containing the surfaces. The amount of possible rotation depends on where the mouse is when the leftMB is first pressed and the direction of drag.
</li>
<li>
MOVE: 
The view may also be moved side to side and up or down by dragging the mouse with the right
mouse button (rightMB) pressed.
</li>
<li>
ZOOM: 
The view can also be zoomed closer or farther away by dragging the mouse with the left and
right mouse buttons (leftMB-rightMB) pressed.
</li>
<li>
Retrieve INFO: 
To retrieve Info for the simulation data value at a particular membrane location, hold the control key on the keyboard down while clicking the leftMB. The data value will appear in red along with the centroid coordinate of the membrane patch under the mouse pick.
</li>
<li>
HOME: 
A preset "HOME" view (button in the window upper left) is provided to allow users to reset their
view to a default perspective.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bounding Box
The bounding box (checkbox in the window upper left) can be turned on and off to show where
membranes surfaces are located with respect to the entire simulation data volume.
</p>
<p>
Surface Table
All membrane surfaces are listed in the viewer's table.
</p>
<ul><li>
Name: Name of the membrane.
</li>
<li>
Size: Membrane surface area given in square microns.
</li>
<li>
Visible: Checkbox in "visible" column allows the user to turn on and of the viewing of surfaces. Making a particular surface invisible allows for viewing interior surfaces that would otherwise be ob- scured.
</li>
<li>
Wireframe: 
Checkbox in "wireframe" column allows the user to produce an outline of each simulation mesh
volume element. The resulting outline is only a gross approximation of the actual computa- tional surface used to generate the simulation data.
</li>
<li>
Transparent: 
Listbox in "transparent" column allows users to select any other value than "none" so that the surface will be displayed allowing any underlying surfaces to also be visible. The larger the number selected, the more any underlying surfaces will show through on the display.
</li>
</ul>
