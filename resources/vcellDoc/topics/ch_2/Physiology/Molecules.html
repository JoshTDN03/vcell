<p><h2>Molecules</h2></p>
<p><b>Molecules</b> are the principal component of rule-based model specification. 
	They are used to create <a href="Species.html">Species</a>, 
	define <a href="ReactionRules.html"> Reaction Rules</a> and 
	<a href="Observables.html">Observables</a>. 
	Molecules are structured objects comprised of components (called <b>sites</b>) that can
	bind to each other, both within a molecule and between molecules. <b>Sites</b> typically
	represent physical parts of proteins, such as the SH2 and SH3 domains of the adapter protein
	Grb2. <b>Sites</b> may also be associated with a list of states, 
	intended to represent states or properties of the site, e.g. phosphorylation status  	
	</p>
<p>
	The Molecules Tab displays a table of the Molecule name, Cartoon depiction of each molecule and the 
	<a href="../../Ch_9/Appendix/Definitions.html#def_BioNetGen">
<i> BioNetGen </i></a> molecular definition. In the Cartoon, green circle denotes 
	molecular site, while small yellow circle denotes that this Site has possible states. 
	Selecting molecule brings the <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_Molecules.html">Molecule Properties</a> 
	in the bottom right pane, where a user can specify and edit a selected <b>Molecule</b>.

<p><p><b>Edit</b> A molecule can be specified in two ways:
	<ul><li>If a user is proficient in BNGL, initial specification can be done as BNGL string, with a user clicking on 
	(Add new here) in the Name column, and then typing or copying BNGL string into BioNetGen definition field. 
	This way of specification is useful when a new Molecule is copied from external BNGL code. 
	Once Enter is pressed, the <b>Molecule</b> definition is no more editable in the table.
	</li>
<li>Alternative way is to enter a name of a Molecule here, and specify it in 
	the <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_Molecules.html">Molecule Properties</a> bottom pane. 
	This is the only way to edit existing molecules, it guarantees that Molecule definition is updated 
	everywhere in the model - in <a href="Species.html">Species</a>, 
	 <a href="ReactionRules.html"> Reaction Rules</a> and <a href="Observables.html">Observables</a>.  
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Filter</b> the list of species using the Search Box to enter a species name or a structure name.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> molecules by highlighting and using the "Delete" button below the table.
	Molecule will not be deleted if it is used elsewhere in the model.</p>
<p><b>Add annotation </b> about the molecules within the <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_Molecules.html"> 
	Molecule Properties pane </a> in the bottom window.</p>
