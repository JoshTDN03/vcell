<p><h2>Reactions Table View</h2></p>
<p>
	A table of <a href="Reactions.html"> reactions</a> and membrane fluxes can be used to create and edit reactions. 
	</p>
<p>
	The table shows the reaction, a user defined name for the reaction, the structure where the reaction occurs
	and the type of kinetic law governing the reaction.
	If the reaction is linked to a pathway object, a link to that object will be shown in the Link column. 
	Mousing over a link will open a tooltip box with additional information about the linked object.
	Double click on that link to navigate to the Pathway Diagram and highlight the object linked to the reaction. 	
	 
	 <p>The bottom pane of the window displays a <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_Reactions.html"> Reaction Properties Pane</a>,
	or <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_MemFlux.html"> Membrane Flux property pane</a>, depending on the current selection. </p>
</p>
<p><b>Enter</b> a new reaction by double clicking "add new" in the table.  In the popup box select the structure
	where the reaction occurs, define a name for the reaction and type the reaction using the format "a+b->c" 
	where a and b, etc. are reactants and c, etc are products. Numbers before a species name are used to indicate 
	stoichiometry.   If a, b, etc have not been defined, they are automatically created as species within the 
	structure where the reaction occurs.

<p><b>Edit</b> kinetic type, rate constants, and catalysts by selecting the reaction or membrane flux 
	in the table and editing the <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_Reactions.html"> Reaction Properties pane</a> or 
	<a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_MemFlux.html"> Flux Properties pane</a> as appropriate.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> a reaction by selecting a row or rows and using the "Delete Selected" button
	 at the bottom of the table.</p>
<p> Use the <a href="PathLink.html"> Pathway Links</a> button to match reactions within 
	<a href="../../Ch_9/Appendix/Definitions.html#def_pathcom">
