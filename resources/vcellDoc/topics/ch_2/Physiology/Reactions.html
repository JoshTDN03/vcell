<p><h2>Reactions</h2></p>
<p><p><b> Reactions tab </b> defines <a href="ReactTabView.html">regular reactions</a> 
		and <a href="ReactionRules.html">reactions rules</a> in the same tabular 
		interface. 
	
		<a href="ReactTabView.html">Regular reactions</a> act on 
		<a href="../../Ch_9/Appendix/Definitions.html#def_species">
<i> species</i></a> (variables) located in compartments or on a membrane 
		and defined by kinetic laws for 
		compartment reactions or membrane fluxes. 
		</p>
<p><b> Create, view and edit </b> reactions and membrane fluxes using either the 
		<a href="ReactTabView.html"> tabular</a> or the <a href="ReactDiagView.html"> 
		diagrammatic</a> views.  
		<b>Properties</b> for reactions and fluxes can be found in the <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_Reactions.html"> Reactions
		 properties pane</a> or <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_MemFlux.html"> Membrane Flux</a> properties pane in the bottom of the window.
	</p>
</p>
<p><a href="ReactionRules.html">Reactions rules</a> act on species patterns 
		 (classes of species having same features), thus they define a class of reactions. Individual reactions are
		 generated by applying reactions rules to the set of initial <a href="Species.html">species</a>. 
		 They can be seen within Application, but are not displayed in 
		 <a href="ReactDiagView.html">Reaction Diagram</a>.   
		<p><b> Create, view and edit </b> reaction rules using  
		<a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_ReactionRules.html">properties pane</a><b>only</b> in the bottom of the window.  </p>
