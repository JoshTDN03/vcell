<p><h2>Reaction Rules</h2></p>
<p><p><b> Reactions </b> define the stoichiometry and kinetics of the BioModel. They consist of 
		<a href="../../Ch_9/Appendix/Definitions.html#def_species">
<i> species</i></a> (variables) and kinetic laws for compartment reactions or membrane fluxes.
		<b>Reactions</b> act on species within an individual or membrane structure, or between a volume and adjacent membrane.  
		<b>Membrane Fluxes</b> occur within membrane structures and act on species of the neighboring volumes.
		(e.g. channels and pumps).</p>
<p><b> Create, view and edit </b> reactions and membrane fluxes using either the 
		<a href="ReactTabView.html"> tabular</a> or the <a href="ReactDiagView.html"> 
		diagrammatic</a> views.  </p>
<b>Properties</b> for reactions and fluxes can be found in the <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_Reactions.html"> Reactions
		 properties pane</a> or <a href="../../ch_8/PropertiesPanes/PP_MemFlux.html"> Membrane Flux</a> properties pane in the bottom of the window.
