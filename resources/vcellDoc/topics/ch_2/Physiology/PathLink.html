<p><h2>Pathway Links</h2></p>
<p> Objects in Physiology (species and reactions) and pathway entities in Pathway Model can be linked.
	The linked objects are marked with a letter 'L'.

	Selecting a single species or a single reaction in a Reaction Diagram, Reactions Table View or 
	Species Table view enables <b>Pathway Links</b> button.
	</p>
<p> 
	If a species or reaction is already linked to a pathway object, 
	there are multiple ways to see <b>Linked pathways objects</b>.
	<ul><li>double click on blue underlined link that appears in the <b>Link</b> columns in <b>Reactions</b> 
	and <b>Species</b> table views, under <b>Linked Pathway Objects</b> in <b>Reaction Diagram</b> view
	Annotations and Pathway in Reaction and Species <b>Object Properties</b>. </li>
<li>Select <b>Show Linked Pathway Objects</b> under <b>Pathway Links</b>menu</li>
</ul>

	As a result, the user will be transfered to <a href="../../ch_6/BiologicalPathways/PathwayDiagram/PathwayDiagramView.html">Pathway Diagram</a> view where
	linked objects will be shown in red.

<p><b>Editing Pathway Links.</b> The user can link/unlink every species and reaction to an 
	every physical entity and interaction in Pathway model.
Selecting <b>Pathway Links -> Edit Pathway Links...</b> will start a dialog box with the list of 
all objects that can be linked
(physical entities for a species or interactions for a reaction). The user can create new links or deleted existing links by checking/unchecking 
checkboxes in the dialog. As usual, Search field is provided for easy filtering.
