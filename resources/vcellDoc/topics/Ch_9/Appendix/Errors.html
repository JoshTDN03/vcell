	</p>
<p><p><b>Kinetics Errors</b></p>
<ul><li><b>General Current Kinetics expected within a flux reaction only.</b><p>

		</p>
</li>
<li><b>GeneralPermeability Kinetics must have exactly one reactant/product.</b><p>
		This error is displayed when the user chooses 'General Permeability Kinetics' for a reaction that does not have exactly one reactant and one product.

		In a kinetics rate expression, if the parameters used in the expression are cyclically dependent, 
		for example : if parameter 'a' is defined in terms of 'b' and parameter 'b' is defined in terms of 'a'; there is cyclic dependency between 'a' and 'b'.
		This is not allowed in the Virtual Cell.
		</p>
</li>
<li><b>references undefined symbol 'symbolName'.</b><p>
		The kinetics rate expression uses a symbol that has not been previously defined in the model and is not a local kinetic parameter.

		</p>
</li>
<li><b>Compartment/Membrane 'structureName' is not mapped to a geometry subdomain.</b><p>
		The feature or membrane represented 'structureName' has not been mapped to any subdomains in the specified geometry for the application.

		this error is thrown when user tries to generate the math (by creating a simulation in a BioModel application or when user edits the math description language and clicks the 'Apply Changes' button in a MathModel).
		Specify a geometry if the application/MathModel is a spatial one, or choose the default conpartmental geometry to proceed.
		</p>
</li>
<li><b>Constant cannot be evaluated to a number: 'expression'</b><p>
		When math is being generated, if a variable has been created as a constant but is an expression that does not evaluate to a constant, this error is thrown.

</li>
<li><b>Expression Binding Exception</b><p>
		During math generation, when generating the equation rates, initial conditions and other expressions for each subdomain, 
		if the rate, initial condition or any other expression cannot be bound to the 'MathDescription'

		</p>
</li>
<li><b>Compartmental Model requires the subdomain be a CompartmentSubDomain</b><p>
		While generating math, if a compartmental (nonspatial) model has one subdomain, but it is not a compartmentalSunDomain, this error is generated.

		</p>
</li>
<li><b>Spatial model, there are 'n' subdomains in geometry, but 'm' CompartmentSubDomains in math description. They must match.</b><p>
		While generating math, in a spatial model, the number of subdomains defined in the geometry must equal the number of CompartmentSubDomains
		defined in the math. This error is thrown when the two are not equal.
		</p>
</li>
<li><b>Spatial model, there are no FilamentSubDomains defined, cannot define FilamentVariable or FilamentRegionVariable.</b><p>
