	The <b>Login</b> dialog prompts user to provide a user name and password. Clicking <b>OK</b> authenticates the user name and password and if successful, the user is logged in and can proceed with editing/creating models. 
	Clicking <b>Cancel</b> cancels the login process. The user can still create models, but cannot save or run simulations.

<p>
	If the user has forgotten his/her password, clicking on the <b>Forgot Login Password...</b> button displays a message to the user saying that the password will be sent via email to the user's currently registered email address.
	The user can choose to accept or cancel the operation.
