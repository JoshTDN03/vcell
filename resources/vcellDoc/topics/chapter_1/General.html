<p><h2>Overview</h2></p>
<p> 
The Virtual Cell Software requires BioModels and
Geometries to generate the mathematical code
needed for running simulations. The BioModel consists
of the model description (Physiology), and the
Application. 
<p></p>

The <a href="../chapter_2/PhysOverview.html"> Physiology</a> 
includes what is known
about the biological system in terms of cellular structures, 
species and biochemical reactions. 
<p></p>

The <a href="../chapter_3/ApplicationOverview.html"> Application</a> 
allows the user to define the 
quantitative conditions needed to define, run and visualize a Virtual
Experiment, i.e. numerical simulation. Thus, an
Application includes the Geometry, the Specifications (species, 
reactions), Protocols (events, electrical mapping), Simulations and 
Parameter Estimation (if applicable).
<p></p>

The Application establishes the relationship between the biological 
model and the <a href="../chapter_3/Geometry/GeometryOverview.html"> Geometry</a>.
<p></p>

A single BioModel may have numerous 
Applications related to it, in which
geometries and/or parameters have been changed.
