<p><h2>BioModels.net Database</h2></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/">BioModels.net</a> database is a data resource that allows researchers to store, search and retrieve published mathematical models of biological interest.	
	The database contains a list of curated models stored in SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) format, and that can be converted to and from a set of limited representative formats.

	The Biomodels.net database models in the Virtual Cell are accessed from the 'Database' panel on the lower left corner of any VCell document window.
	Clicking the <b>BioModels.net</b> tab displays a list of models from the BioModels.net repository that can be imported into the Virtual Cell.
	A <b>Search</b> section above the list of models allows the user to select a particular model by name (by specifying a name in the provided text field and clicking the <b>Search</b> button) 
	or to show all models that can be imported into the Virtual Cell (by using the <b>Show All</b> button).
	Selecting a model from the list and clicking the <b>Import</b> button will import the model into the Virtual Cell as a BioModel.
	
	<p>
	When a model is selected from the list, some basic information about the model, such as name, entry ID in BioModels.net database, a hyperlink to the model on the BioModels.net website is displayed 
	in the 'Database File Info' tab of the 'Properties' panel of the open VCell document. Double-clicking the hyperlinks in this tab will open the corresponding page in a web browser.
	An example 'Database File Info' for the 'Aguda1999_CellCycle' model in BioModels.net database is displayed in the figure below.
