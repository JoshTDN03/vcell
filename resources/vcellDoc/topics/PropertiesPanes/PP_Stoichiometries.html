<p><h2>Stoichiometry Tab</h2></p>
<p> 
  On selection of a reactant or product line in the reaction diagram, the stoichiometry properties panel is shown
  which serves to edit the stoichiometric coefficient, which can be any positive integer and is set to 1 by default.

    This panel only displays an editable text field that contains the stoichiometric coefficient.
    </p>
</p>
<p><p>
	A new stoichiometric coefficient can be entered into the text field. Only positive integers are allowed,
	all other values will be silently discarded.
