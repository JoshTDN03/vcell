The Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method uses an O(h4) method together with an O(h5) method that uses all of the points of the O(h4) method, and hence is often referred to as an RKF45 method. Similar schemes with different orders have since been developed. By performing one extra calculation that would be required for an RK5 method, the error in the solution can be estimated and controlled and an appropriate step size can be determined automatically, making this method efficient for ordinary problems of automated numerical integration of ordinary differential equations."

It simulates each molecule of interest individually to capture natural stochasticity and for nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It treats other molecules implicity, so it can simulate tens of thousands of molecules over several minutes of real time. Simulated molecules diffuse, react, are confined by surfaces, and bind to membranes much as they would in a real biological system."
