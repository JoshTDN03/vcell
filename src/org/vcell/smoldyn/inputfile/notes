can specify either reaction rate, or probability per collision for surface reactions

use primitives?

how should enums be handled?

what type of exceptions should be thrown?

where do 'all' qualifiers fit in?  as in, when species must be given, and 'all' is the value

privacy settings on constructors:  should they all be public?

should data members be set to null when declared?

when should arraylists be used versus plain-old arrays?

species -> state -> molecule hierarchy may be wrong.  see Reaction.java

how should keywords be organized?  some words are used in two separate categories....
	should there be an enum for each category?
	
domains:  what are they, and how are they modeled in Smoldyn?




###### Smoldyn problems

Smoldyn timings that don't work:  n, e, j

surfaces:  Smoldyn chokes when giving a surface an epsilon or neighbor_dist value, even though the documentation says
		that surfaces can take those values

Smoldyn complains about having a jump surface only jump on one side, but it doesn't seem to be a problem when running the simulation:
		it seems to run exactly as expected
		
Smoldyn's support for actions seems to be undocumented/unusable -- may have to cover these with reactions
