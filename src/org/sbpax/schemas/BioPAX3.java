		"the same reference entity. For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, " +

		"record, C', describing the same chemical compound in an external database, one would use a " + 
		"unification xref since records C and C' describe the same biological identity. Generally, " +

		"might not be useful, such as application to application data exchange.\n" +
		"Comment: Unification xrefs in physical entities are essential for data integration, " + 
		"but are less important in interactions. This is because unification xrefs on the " + 
		"physical entities in an interaction can be used to compute the equivalence of two " + 
		"interactions of the same type. An xref in a protein pointing to a gene, e.g. in the " + 
		"LocusLink database17, would not be a unification xref since the two entities do not have " + 
		"the same biological identity (one is a protein, the other is a gene). Instead, this link " + 
		"should be a captured as a relationship xref. References to an external controlled " + 
		"vocabulary term within the OpenControlledVocabulary class should use a unification xref " + 
		"where possible (e.g. GO:0005737).\n" +
