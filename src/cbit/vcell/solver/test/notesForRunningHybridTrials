Run hybrid trials locally-------------------------

1. create a local run directory (say C:\testHybrid\localRun)
2. Open your hybrid model and run a simulation with your desired setting(better keep one sim only) and then export to .vcml
3. The ".vcml" should be copied to the local run directory, and simulation files(SimID_xyzxyz_0*) should be copied to there too. 
4. Open HybridSolverTester.java change uncomment code at line 96 and comment code at line 101  
5. Create a run configuration for HybridSolverTester with 5 arguments:
   a. ".vcml" file(full path)
   b. starting trial number
   c. number of trials to run
   d. variables(from varible statistcs) to be saved(separated with ':')
   e. print time or not (true or false)
   
Run hybrid trials on server-----------------------
*Run on sigcluster as user "vcell", run it on test site*
1. create a directory on test site (say /Share/apps/.../test/testHybrid)
2. create directories on your local computer (C:\testHybrid\batchSubmissionFiles\). if you name your directory other names, please change WORK_DIR
   in BatchJobSubmissionGenerator.java accordingly. 
3. Open your hybrid model and run a simulation with your desired setting(better keep one sim only) and then export to .vcml
4. The ".vcml" should be copied to your local computer C:\testHybrid\batchSubmissionFiles\.
5. Open BatchJobSubmissionGenerator.java and read and change the static variables carefully. Pay attention to WORK_DIR,TOTAL_NUM_JOB, ARG_1, ARG_4, TOTAL_NUM_TRIAL.
6. Create a run configuration for BatchJobSubmissionGenerator(no arguments) and run it.
7. Job scripts will be generated and saved to WORK_DIR, submission script is generated and runhybridtest script is copied (stored in vcell.solver.test pkg).
8. Upload everything under WORK_DIR to /share/apps/vcell/deployed/test/testHybrid/ (or from windows file explorer \\cfs01.cam.uchc.edu\ifs\RAID\vcell\deployed\test\testHybrid)
9. Log into sigcluster through any SSH client and go to /share/apps/vcell/deployed/test/testHybrid/
10.Run "./submission"
11.Jobs will be submitted every 40s. 
12.Results will be written into the same directory.
13.Copy the results file to local and concatenate results for each variable using "copy *.ext varName.txt"
